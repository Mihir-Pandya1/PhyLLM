    "question": "Explain the concept of MOTION IN A PLANE",
    "answer": "In the last chapter we developed the concepts of position, displacement, velocity and acceleration that are needed to describe the motion of an object along a straight line. We found that the directional aspect of these quantities can be taken care of by + and signs, as in one dimension only two directions are possible. But in order to describe motion of an object in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions (space), we need to use vectors to describe the above- mentioned physical quantities. Therefore, it is first necessary to learn the language of vectors. How to add, subtract and multiply vectors? What is the result of multiplying a vector by a real number? We shall learn this to enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and acceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object in a plane. As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail the projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of motion that has a special significance in daily-life situations. We shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail. The equations developed in this chapter for motion in a plane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions.",

  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of Scalars and Vectors",
    "answer": "In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or vectors. Basically, the difference is that a direction is associated with a vector but not with a scalar. A scalar quantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified completely by a single number, along with the proper unit. Examples are the distance between two points, mass of an object, the temperature of a body and the time at which a certain event happened. The rules for combining scalars are the rules of ordinary algebra. Scalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided just as the ordinary numbers. For example, if the length and breadth of a rectangle are 1.0 m and 0.5 m respectively, then its perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the four sides, $1.0~m+0.5~m+1.0~m+0.5~m = 3.0~m$. The length of each side is a scalar and the perimeter is also a scalar. A vector quantity is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction and obeys the triangle law of addition or equivalently the parallelogram law of addition. So, a vector is specified by giving its magnitude by a number and its direction. Some physical quantities that are represented by vectors are displacement, velocity, acceleration and force. To represent a vector, we use a bold face type in this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be represented by a symbol v. Since bold face is difficult to produce, when written by hand, a vector is often represented by an arrow placed over a letter, say $\\vec{v}$. Thus, both v and $\\vec{v}$ represent the velocity vector. The magnitude of a vector is often called its absolute value, indicated by $|v|$. A vector is represented by a bold face, e.g. by A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light face A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y.",

  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of Position and Displacement Vectors",
    "answer": "To describe the position of an object moving in a plane, we need to choose a convenient point, say O as origin. Let P and P' be the positions of the object at time t and t', respectively. We join O and P by a straight line. Then, OP is the position vector of the object at time t. An arrow is marked at the head of this line. It is represented by a symbol r, i.e. $OP=r$. Point P' is represented by another position vector, OP' denoted by r'. The length of the vector r represents the magnitude of the vector and its direction is the direction in which P lies as seen from O. If the object moves from P to P', the vector PP' (with tail at P and tip at P') is called the displacement vector corresponding to motion from point P (at time t) to point P' (at time t'). It is important to note that displacement vector is the straight line joining the initial and final positions and does not depend on the actual path undertaken by the object between the two positions. For example, given the initial and final positions as P and Q, the displacement vector is the same PQ for different paths of journey. Therefore, the magnitude of displacement is either less or equal to the path length of an object between two points. This fact was emphasised in the previous chapter also while discussing motion along a straight line.",

Multiplying a vector A by a negative number $-\\lambda$ gives another vector whose direction is opposite to the direction of A and whose magnitude is $\\lambda$ times A. The factor $\\lambda$ by which a vector A is multiplied could be a scalar having its own physical dimension. Then, the dimension of A is the product of the dimensions of $\\lambda$ and A.

    "question": "Explain the concept of Addition and Subtraction of Vectors - Graphical Method",
    "answer": "Vectors, by definition, obey the triangle law or equivalently, the parallelogram law of addition. To find the sum $A+B$, we place vector B so that its tail is at the head of the vector A. Then, we join the tail of A to the head of B. This line OQ represents a vector R, that is, the sum of the vectors A and B. This graphical method is called the head-to-tail method. The two vectors and their resultant form three sides of a triangle, so this method is also known as triangle method of vector addition. If we find the resultant of $B+A$, the same vector R is obtained. Thus, vector addition is commutative: $A+B=B+A$. The addition of vectors also obeys the associative law: $(A+B)+C=A+(B+C)$. The sum of two equal and opposite vectors, A and -A, is a null vector or a zero vector, represented by 0, with zero magnitude: $A-A=0$. Subtraction of vectors is defined as the sum of two vectors A and -B: $A-B=A+(-B)$. We can also use the parallelogram method: bring their tails to a common origin, and the resultant vector R is the diagonal of the parallelogram from the common origin. The two methods are equivalent.",

This is called resolving a vector into its component vectors. It is convenient to resolve a vector along the axes of a rectangular coordinate system using unit vectors $\\hat{i}$, $\\hat{j}$, and $\\hat{k}$ for the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. A vector A lying in the x-y plane can be expressed as $A=A_{x}\\hat{i}+A_{y}\\hat{j}$. The quantities $A_x$ and $A_y$ are the x- and y-components of A.

    "answer": "The analytical method of adding vectors is often easier and more accurate than the graphical method. To add two vectors A and B, you add their corresponding components. For two vectors in the x-y plane, $A=A_{x}\\hat{i}+A_{y}\\hat{j}$ and $B=B_{x}\\hat{i}+B_{y}\\hat{j}$, their sum is $R=A+B=(A_{x}+B_{x})\\hat{i}+(A_{y}+B_{y})\\hat{j}$. Thus, the components of the resultant vector are $R_{x}=A_{x}+B_{x}$ and $R_{y}=A_{y}+B_{y}$. This method can be extended to three dimensions.

    "question": "Explain the concept of LAWS OF MOTION",
    "answer": "In the preceding Chapter, our concern was to describe the motion of a particle in space quantitatively. We saw that uniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas non-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in addition. So far, we have not asked the question as to what governs the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this basic question. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it. To throw a stone upwards, one has to give it an upward push. A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a strong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a flowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external agency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest. Likewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop motion. You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by applying a force against the direction of its motion. In these examples, the external agency of force (hands, wind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not always necessary. A stone released from the top of a building accelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the earth. A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance. This shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and magnetic forces) can exert force on a body even from a distance. In short, a force is required to put a stationary body in motion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is needed to provide this force. The external agency may or may not be in contact with the body. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g. a skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal ice slab)?

    "answer": "The question posed above appears to be simple. However, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the correct answer to this question given by Galileo in the seventeenth century was the foundation of Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the birth of modern science. The Greek thinker, Aristotle (384 B.C-322 B.C.), held the view that if a body is moving, something external is required to keep it moving. The Aristotelian law of motion may be phrased thus: An external force is required to keep a body in motion. This law is flawed because a moving toy car, for example, comes to rest because the external force of friction on the car by the floor opposes its motion. To counter this force, a child has to apply an external force on the car in the direction of motion. When the car is in uniform motion, there is no net external force acting on it: the force by the child cancels the force (friction) by the floor. If there were no friction, the child would not be required to apply any force to keep the toy car in uniform motion. Galileo imagined a world without frictional forces to arrive at the true law of nature for forces and motion.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of The Law of Inertia",
    "answer": "Galileo studied motion of objects on an inclined plane. He concluded that an object moving on a frictionless horizontal plane must neither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it should move with constant velocity. Another experiment by Galileo involved a double inclined plane, where a ball released from rest on one plane would climb up the other. In the ideal situation, when friction is absent, the final height of the ball is the same as its initial height. In the limiting case, when the slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a horizontal), the ball would travel an infinite distance, and its motion would never cease. Galileo arrived at the insight that the state of rest and the state of uniform linear motion (motion with constant velocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is no net force acting on the body. To maintain a body in uniform motion, an external force is needed to counter the frictional force, so that the two forces sum up to zero net external force. This property of the body is called inertia, which means 'resistance to change'. A body does not change its state of rest or uniform motion unless an external force compels it to change that state. The state of rest or uniform linear motion both imply zero acceleration. The first law of motion can be simply expressed as: If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero.",

Force was thought to be of different kinds: force due to continuous pressure (nodan), impact (abhighat), persistent tendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line (vega), or restoration of shape in an elastic body. The notion of (vega) perhaps comes closest to the concept of inertia. Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to be opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air resistance. It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational and vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent particles. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of motion and units of length and time. Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept of 'instantaneous motion' (tatkaliki gati), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous velocity using Differential Calculus.

Newton's first law of motion states: Every body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise. If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero. For example, a spaceship in interstellar space with its rockets turned off has no net external force acting on it, so its acceleration must be zero. If it is in motion, it continues to move with a uniform velocity. On Earth, an object at rest or in uniform linear motion is not because there are no forces acting on it, but because the various external forces cancel out to give a zero net external force. The property of inertia is evident when a bus suddenly starts or stops, causing passengers to be thrown backward or forward, respectively.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Newton's second law of motion",
    "answer": "The first law refers to the simple case when the net external force on a body is zero. The second law of motion refers to the general situation when there is a net external force acting on the body. It relates the net external force to the acceleration of the body. Momentum (p) of a body is defined as the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v): $p=mv$ (4.1). The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. The second law can be expressed as $F=k\\frac{dp}{dt}$ where k is a constant of proportionality. For a body of fixed mass, this can be written as $F=kma$. In SI units, k is chosen to be 1, so the law becomes $F=\\frac{dp}{dt}=ma$. The SI unit of force is the newton (N), defined as $1~N=1~kg~m~s^{-2}$. The second law is a vector law and is consistent with the first law (F=0 implies a=0). The acceleration at an instant is determined by the force at that instant, not by the history of the motion. The second law applies to a single point particle, a rigid body, or a system of particles, where F is the total external force and a is the acceleration of the system's center of mass. Impulse is defined as the product of force and time duration, which equals the change in momentum. For a seasoned cricketer catching a ball, drawing hands backward increases the time for the momentum change, thus requiring a smaller force.",

What is (i) the direction of the force on the wall due to each ball? (ii) the ratio of the magnitudes of impulses imparted to the balls by the wall?\n\n**Answer**\nAn instinctive but wrong answer is that the force on the wall in case (b) is inclined at 30 degrees to the normal. The force on the wall is normal to the wall in both cases. Let u be the speed and m be the mass of each ball. We choose x and y axes as shown in the figure.\nCase (a): The initial x-component of momentum is $p_{x,initial}=mu$, and the final x-component is $p_{x,final}=-mu$. The y-component of momentum is zero both before and after the collision. The x-component of impulse is the change in momentum, which is $-2mu$. The force on the ball is in the negative x-direction, normal to the wall. By Newton's third law, the force on the wall is in the positive x-direction, normal to the wall.\nCase (b): The initial x-component of momentum is $(p_{x})_{initial}=mu\\cos30^{\\circ}$ and the final is $(p_{x})_{final}=-mu\\cos30^{\\circ}$. The y-component of momentum does not change. The x-component of impulse is $-2mu\\cos30^{\\circ}$. The direction of force is again normal to the wall along the negative x-direction. By Newton's third law, the force on the wall is normal to the wall along the positive x-direction. The ratio of the magnitudes of the impulses in (a) and (b) is $\\frac{2mu}{2mu\\cos30^{\\circ}}=\\frac{1}{\\cos30^{\\circ}}=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\approx1.2$.",

What is the tension in the string? (Take $g=10~m/s^{2}$). Neglect the mass of the string.\n\n**Answer**\nSince the string is inextensible and the pulley is smooth, the 3 kg block and the 20 kg trolley have the same magnitude of acceleration. Applying the second law to the block: $30-T=3a$. Applying the second law to the trolley: $T-f_{k}=20a$. The kinetic friction is $f_{k}=\\mu_{k}N=\\mu_{k}mg=0.04\\times(20\\times10)=8~N$. The equation for the trolley's motion is $T-8=20a$. Solving these two equations gives $a=\\frac{22}{23}~m~s^{-2}\\approx0.96~m~s^{-2}$ and $T=27.1~N$.",

    "answer": "A body rolling without slipping over a horizontal plane will, in an ideal situation, experience no friction. In practice, however, rolling friction does occur, and an applied force is needed to keep the body rolling. For the same weight, rolling friction is much smaller than static or sliding friction, which is why the discovery of the wheel was a major milestone. Rolling friction is caused by the slight deformation of the surfaces in contact, resulting in a finite area of contact rather than a single point. Rolling friction is often undesirable in machines, and lubricants or ball bearings are used to reduce it.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Circular motion",
    "answer": "The acceleration of a body moving in a circle of radius R with uniform speed v is $v^{2}/R$ directed towards the centre. According to Newton's second law, the force providing this acceleration is the centripetal force, $f_{c}=\\frac{mv^{2}}{R}$ (4.16). This force is always directed towards the center. For a car taking a circular turn on a horizontal road, the centripetal force is provided by the force of static friction. The maximum speed for a car on a level road is given by $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\mu_{s}Rg}$ (4.18), which is independent of the car's mass. On a banked road, the horizontal components of the normal force and the frictional force provide the centripetal force. The maximum permissible speed on a banked road is given by $v_{max}=(Rg\\frac{\\mu_{s}+tan\\theta}{1-\\mu_{s}tan\\theta})^{1/2}$ (4.21). At the optimum speed, $v_{o}=(R~g~tan~\\theta)^{1/2}$, frictional force is not needed at all.",

What is the action of the block on the floor (a) before and (b) after the floor yields? (Take $g=10~m~s^{-2}$). Identify the action-reaction pairs in the problem.\n\n**Answer**\n(a) Before the floor yields, the block is at rest. The force of gravity on the block is $2\\times10=20~N$ and the normal force R from the floor is also 20 N (by the First Law). By the third law, the action of the block on the floor is 20 N downwards.\n(b) After the floor yields, the total mass is $2+25=27~kg$. The system accelerates downwards with $0.1~m~s^{-2}$. The forces on the system are gravity ($27\\times10=270~N$) and the normal force $R'$ from the floor. Applying the second law to the system: $270-R'=27\\times0.1$, which gives $R'=267.3~N$. By the third law, the action of the system on the floor is 267.3 N downwards.\n**Action-reaction pairs**\n* For (a): The force of gravity (20 N) on the block by the earth and the force of gravity on the earth by the block (reaction).

  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of SUMMARY",
    "answer": "1. Aristotle's view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong. In practice, a force is necessary to counter opposing forces like friction.\n2. Newton's first law of motion is based on Galileo's law of inertia: \"Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise\". In simple terms, if the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero.\n3. Momentum (p) is the product of a body's mass (m) and velocity (v): $p=mv$.\n4. Newton's second law states that the rate of change of momentum is proportional to the applied force. The equation is $F=\\frac{dp}{dt}=ma$, where F is the net external force and a is acceleration. The SI unit of force is the newton ($1~N=1~kg~m~s^{-2}$).\n5. Impulse is the product of force and time, equal to the change in momentum.\n6. Newton's third law states: \"To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction\". Forces always occur in pairs, acting on different bodies.\n7. The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved, a consequence of the second and third laws.\n8. Frictional force opposes impending or actual relative motion between surfaces. Static friction ($f_{s}$) opposes impending motion ($f_{s}\\le\\mu_{s}R$), and kinetic friction ($f_{k}$) opposes actual motion ($f_{k}=\\mu_{k}R$). The coefficient of kinetic friction $\\mu_{k}$ is less than the coefficient of static friction $\\mu_{s}$.\n9. The centripetal force is not a new kind of force but is the force that provides the inward radial acceleration for circular motion.",

The base units for length, mass and time in these systems were as follows: In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second respectively. In FPS system they were foot, pound and second respectively. In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second respectively. The system of units which is at present internationally accepted for measurement is the Système Internationale d' Unites (French for International System of Units), abbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols, units and abbreviations, developed by the Bureau International des Poids et measures (The International Bureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM) in 1971 were recently revised by the General Conference on Weights and Measures in November 2018. The scheme is now for international usage in scientific, technical, industrial and commercial work. Because SI units used decimal system, conversions within the system are quite simple and convenient. We shall follow the SI units in this book. In SI, there are seven base units as given in Table 1.1. Besides the seven base units, there are two more units that are defined for (a) plane angle $d\\theta$ as the ratio of length of arc ds to the radius r and (b) solid angle $d\\Omega$ as the ratio of the intercepted area dA of the spherical surface, described about the apex O as the centre, to the square of its radius r, as shown in Fig. 1.1(a) and (b) respectively. The unit for plane angle is radian with the symbol rad and the unit for the solid angle is steradian with the symbol sr. Both these are dimensionless quantities.",

We employ units for some physical quantities that can be derived from the seven base units (Appendix A 6). Some derived units in terms of the SI base units are given in (Appendix A 6.1). Some SI derived units are given special names (Appendix A 6.2) and some derived SI units make use of these units with special names and the seven base units (Appendix A 6.3). These are given in Appendix A 6.2 and A 6.3 for your ready reference. Other units retained for general use are given in Table 1.2. Common SI prefixes and symbols for multiples and sub-multiples are given in Appendix A2. General guidelines for using symbols for physical quantities, chemical elements and nuclides are given in Appendix A7 and those for SI units and some other units are given in Appendix A8 for your guidance and ready reference. As discussed above, every measurement involves errors. Thus, the result of measurement should be reported in a way that indicates the precision of measurement. Normally, the reported result of measurement is a number that includes all digits in the number that are known reliably plus the first digit that is uncertain. The reliable digits plus the first uncertain digit are known as significant digits or significant figures. If we say the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are reliable and certain, while the digit 2 is uncertain. Thus, the measured value has three significant figures. The length of an object reported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly, reporting",

The rules for determining the number of significant figures can be understood from the following examples. Significant figures indicate, as already mentioned, the precision of measurement which depends on the least count of the measuring instrument. A choice of change of different units does not change the number of significant digits or figures in a measurement. This important remark makes most of the following observations clear: (1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four significant figures. But in different units, the same value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08 mm or $23080~\\mu m$. All these numbers have the same number of significant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Rules for Significant Figures",
    "answer": "This shows that the location of decimal point is of no consequence in determining the number of significant figures. The example gives the following rules:\nAll the non-zero digits are significant.\nAll the zeros between two non-zero digits are significant, no matter where the decimal point is, if at all.\nIf the number is less than 1, the zero(s) on the right of decimal point but to the left of the first non-zero digit are not significant. [In 0.00 2308, the underlined zeroes are not significant].\nThe terminal or trailing zero(s) in a number without a decimal point are not significant. [Thus $123~m=12300~cm=123000$ mm has three significant figures, the trailing zero(s) being not significant.] However, you can also see the next observation.\nThe trailing zero(s) in a number with a decimal point are significant. [The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four significant figures each.]\n(2) There can be some confusion regarding the trailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to be 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here are meant to convey the precision of measurement and are, therefore, significant. [If these were not, it would be superfluous to write them explicitly, the reported measurement would have been simply 4.7 ml. Now suppose we change units, then $4.700~m=470.0~cm=4700~mm=0.004700~km$. Since the last number has trailing zero(s) in a number with no decimal, we would conclude erroneously from observation (1) above that the number has two significant figures, while in fact, it has four significant figures and a mere change of units cannot change the number of significant figures.",

  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of Rules for Significant Figures",
    "answer": "(3) To remove such ambiguities in determining the number of significant figures, the best way is to report every measurement in scientific notation (in the power of 10). In this notation, every number is expressed as $a\\times10^{b}$ where a is a number between 1 and 10, and b is any positive or negative exponent (or power) of 10. In order to get an approximate idea of the number, we may round off the number a to 1 (for $a\\le5$) and to 10 (for $5<a\\le10)$. Then the number can be expressed approximately as $10^{b}$ in which the exponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of magnitude of the physical quantity. When only an estimate is required, the quantity is of the order of $10^{b}$ For example, the diameter of the earth $(1.28\\times10^{7}m)$ is of the order of $10^{7}m$ with the order of magnitude 7. The diameter of hydrogen atom $(1.06\\times10^{-10}m)$ is of the order of $10^{-10}m$, with the order of magnitude -10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders of magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom. It is often customary to write the decimal after the first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in (a) above disappears : $4.700~m=4.700\\times10^{2}cm =4.700\\times10^{3}mm=4.700\\times10^{-3}km$. The power of 10 is irrelevant to the determination of significant figures. However, all zeroes appearing in the base number in the scientific notation are significant. Each number in this case has four significant figures. Thus, in the scientific notation, no confusion arises about the trailing zero(s) in the base number a. They are always significant.",

For a number with a decimal, the trailing zero(s) are significant.\n(5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a decimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250) is never significant. However, the zeroes at the end of such number are significant in a measurement.\n(6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are neither rounded numbers nor numbers representing measured values are exact and have infinite number of significant digits.

    "answer": "The result of a calculation involving approximate measured values of quantities (i.e. values with limited number of significant figures) must reflect the uncertainties in the original measured values. It cannot be more accurate than the original measured values themselves on which the result is based. In general, the final result should not have more significant figures than the original data from which it was obtained. Thus, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be $2.51~cm^{3}$ then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is $1.68804780876~g/cm^{3}$ upto 11 decimal places. It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant to record the calculated value of density to such a precision when the measurements on which the value is based, have much less precision. The following rules for arithmetic operations with significant figures ensure that the final result of a calculation is shown with the precision that is consistent with the precision of the input measured values:\n(1) In multiplication or division, the final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures. Thus, in the example above, density should be reported to three significant figures. Density = $\\frac{4.237g}{2.51~cm^{3}}=1.69~g~cm^{-3}$.

  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of Rounding off the Uncertain Digits",
    "answer": "The result of computation with approximate numbers, which contain more than one uncertain digit, should be rounded off. The rules for rounding off numbers to the appropriate significant figures are obvious in most cases. A number 2.746 rounded off to three significant figures is 2.75, while the number 1.743 would be 1.74. The rule by convention is that the preceding digit is raised by 1 if the insignificant digit to be dropped (the underlined digit in this case) is more than 5, and is left unchanged if the latter is less than 5. But what if the number is 2.745 in which the insignificant digit is 5. Here, the convention is that if the preceding digit is even, the insignificant digit is simply dropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit is raised by 1. Then, the number 2.745 rounded off to three significant figures becomes 1.74. On the other hand, the number 2.735 rounded off to three significant figures becomes 1.74 since the preceding digit is odd. In any involved or complex multi-step calculation, you should retain, in intermediate steps, one digit more than the significant digits and round off to proper significant figures at the end of the calculation. Similarly, a number known to be within many significant figures, such as in $2.99792458\\times10^{8}m/s$ for the speed of light in vacuum, is rounded off to an approximate value $3\\times10^{8}m/s$, which is often employed in computations. Finally, remember that exact numbers that appear in formulae like $2~\\pi~in~T=2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}},$ have a large (infinite) number of significant figures. The value of $\\pi=$ 3.1415926.... is known to a large number of significant figures. You may take the value as 3.142 or 3.14 for $\\pi$. with limited number of significant figures as required in specific cases.",

It means that the length may be written as $16.2 \\pm 0.1~cm$ $=16.2~cm\\pm0.6\\%$. Similarly, the breadth b may be written as $b=10.1\\pm0.1~cm$ $=10.1~cm\\pm1\\%$.

This leads us to quote the final result as $1b164+3~cm^{2}$.

However, if data are subtracted, the number of significant figures can be reduced. For example, 12.9 g - 7.06 g. both specified to three significant figures, cannot properly be evaluated as 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as uncertainties in subtraction or addition combine in a different fashion (smallest number of decimal places rather than the number of significant figures in any of the number added or subtracted).",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Rules for Determining the Uncertainty in the Results of Arithmetic Calculations",
    "answer": "(3) The relative error of a value of number specified to significant figures depends not only on n but also on the number itself. For example, the accuracy in measurement of mass 1.02 g is $\\pm0.01$ g whereas another measurement 9.89 g is also accurate to $\\pm0.01$ g. The relative error in 1.02 g is $=(\\pm0.01/1.02)\\times100\\%$ $=\\pm1\\%$. Similarly, the relative error in 9.89 g is $=(\\pm0.01/9.89)\\times100\\%$ $=\\pm0.1\\%$.\nFinally, remember that intermediate results in a multi-step computation should be calculated to one more significant figure in every measurement than the number of digits in the least precise measurement. These should be justified by the data and then the arithmetic operations may be carried out; otherwise rounding errors can build up. For example, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after rounding off) to the same number of significant figures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of 0.104 calculated to three significant figures is 9.62. However, if we had written $1/9.58=0.1044$ and then taken the reciprocal to three significant figures, we would have retrieved the original value of 9.58. This example justifies the idea to retain one more extra digit (than the number of digits in the least precise measurement) in intermediate steps of the complex multi-step calculations in order to avoid additional errors in the process of rounding off the numbers.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Dimensions of Physical Quantities",
    "answer": "The nature of a physical quantity is described by its dimensions. All the physical quantities represented by derived units can be expressed in terms of some combination of seven fundamental or base quantities. We shall call these base quantities as the seven dimensions of the physical world, which are denoted with square brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the dimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current [A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous intensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol]. The dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers (or exponents) to which the base quantities are raised to represent that quantity. Note that using the square brackets [ ] around a quantity means that we are dealing with 'the dimensions of the quantity. In mechanics, all the physical quantities can be written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M] and [T]. For example, the volume occupied by an object is expressed as the product of length, breadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the dimensions of volume are $[L]\\times[L]\\times[L]=[L]^{3}=[L^{3}]$. As the volume is independent of mass and time, it is said to possess zero dimension in mass [$M^{0}$], zero dimension in time [$T^{0}$] and three dimensions in length. Similarly, force, as the product of mass and acceleration, can be expressed as Force = mass x acceleration = mass $\\times$ (length)/(time)². The dimensions of force are [M] $[L]/[T]^{2}=[MLT^{-2}]$. Thus, the force has one dimension in mass, one dimension in length, and -2 dimensions in time. The dimensions in all other base quantities are zero. Note that in this type of representation, the magnitudes are not considered. It is the quality of the type of the physical quantity that enters.

For example, the dimensional formula of the volume is $[M^{0}L^{3}T^{0}]$, and that of speed or velocity is $[M^{0}LT^{-1}]$. Similarly, $[M^{0}LT^{-2}]$ is the dimensional formula of acceleration and [M $L^{-3}$ $T^{0}$] that of mass density. An equation obtained by equating a physical quantity with its dimensional formula is called the dimensional equation of the physical quantity. Thus, the dimensional equations are the equations, which represent the dimensions of a physical quantity in terms of the base quantities. For example, the dimensional equations of volume [V], speed [u], force [F] and mass density [ρ] may be expressed as $[V]=[M^{0}L^{3}T^{0}]$ $[v]=[M^{0}L~T^{-1}]$ $[F]=[ML~T^{-2}]$ $[ρ]=[M~L^{-3}T^{0}]$. The dimensional equation can be obtained from the equation representing the relations between the physical quantities.

    "question": "Explain the concept of Checking the Dimensional Consistency of Equations",
    "answer": "The magnitudes of physical quantities may be added together or subtracted from one another only if they have the same dimensions. In other words, we can add or subtract similar physical quantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to force, or an electric current cannot be subtracted from the thermodynamic temperature. This simple principle called the principle of homogeneity of dimensions in an equation is extremely useful in checking the correctness of an equation. If the dimensions of all the terms are not same, the equation is wrong. Hence, if we derive an expression for the length (or distance) of an object, regardless of the symbols appearing in the original mathematical relation, when all the individual dimensions are simplified, the remaining dimension must be that of length. Similarly, if we derive an equation of speed, the dimensions on both the sides of equation, when simplified, must be of length/ time, or $[L~T^{-1}]$. Dimensions are customarily used as a preliminary test of the consistency of an equation, when there is some doubt about the correctness of the equation. However, the dimensional consistency does not guarantee correct equations. It is uncertain to the extent of dimensionless quantities or functions. The arguments of special functions, such as the trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions must be dimensionless. A pure number, ratio of similar physical quantities, such as angle as the ratio (length/length), refractive index as the ratio (speed of light in vacuum/speed of light in medium) etc., has no dimensions. Now we can test the dimensional consistency or homogeneity of the equation $x=x_{0}+v_{0}t+(1/2)at^{2}$ for the distance x travelled by a particle or body in time t which starts from the position $x_{0}$ with an initial velocity",

As each term on the right hand side of this equation has the same dimension, namely that of length, which is same as the dimension of left hand side of the equation, hence this equation is a dimensionally correct equation. It may be noted that a test of consistency of dimensions tells us no more and no less than a test of consistency of units, but has the advantage that we need not commit ourselves to a particular choice of units, and we need not worry about conversions among multiples and sub-multiples of the units. It may be borne in mind that if an equation fails this consistency test, it is proved wrong, but if it passes, it is not proved right. Thus, a dimensionally correct equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong (incorrect) or inconsistent equation must be wrong.",

    "answer": "Example 1.4\nThe SI unit of energy is $J=kg~m^{2}s^{-2}$ that of speed v is m $S^{-1}$ and of acceleration a is m $S^{-2}$ , Which of the formulae for kinetic energy (K) given below can you rule out on the basis of dimensional arguments (m stands for the mass of the body):\n(a) $K=m^{3}v^{3}$\n(b) $K=(1/2)mv^{2}$\n(c) $K=ma$\n(d) $K=(3/16)mv^{2}$\n(e) $K=(1/2)mv^{2}+ma$\n\n**Answer**\nEvery correct formula or equation must have the same dimensions on both sides of the equation. Also, only quantities with the same physical dimensions can be added or subtracted. The dimensions of the quantity on the right side are $[M^{2}L^{3}T^{-3}]$ for (a); $[M~L^{2}T^{-2}]$ for (b) and (d); $[M~L~T^{-2}]$ for (c). The quantity on the right side of (e) has no proper dimensions since two quantities of different dimensions have been added. Since the kinetic energy K has the dimensions of $[M~L^{2}T^{-2}]$, formulas (a), (c) and (e) are ruled out. Note that dimensional arguments cannot tell which of the two, (b) or (d), is the correct formula. For this, one must turn to the actual definition of kinetic energy (see Chapter 5). The correct formula for kinetic energy is given by (b).",

Suppose that the period of oscillation of the simple pendulum depends on its length (l), mass of the bob (m) and acceleration due to gravity (g). Derive the expression for its time period using method of dimensions.\n\n**Answer**\nThe dependence of time period T on the quantities l, g and m as a product may be written as: $T=k~l^{x}~g^{y}~m^{z}$ where k is dimensionless constant and x, y and z are the exponents.\nBy considering dimensions on both sides, we have $[L^{0}M^{0}T^{1}]=[L^{1}]^{x}[L^{1}T^{-2}]^{y}[M^{1}]^{z}$ $=L^{x} T^{-2y} M^{z}$.\nOn equating the dimensions on both sides, we have $x+y=0;-2y=1$; and $z=0$.\nSo that $y=-1/2$, $x=1/2$, $z=0$.\nThen, $T=k~l^{\\frac{1}{2}}g^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ or, $T=k\\sqrt{\\frac{l}{g}}$.\nNote that value of constant k can not be obtained by the method of dimensions. Here it does not matter if some number multiplies the right side of this formula, because that does not affect its dimensions. Actually, $k=2\\pi$ so that $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{l}{g}}$.\nDimensional analysis is very useful in deducing relations among the interdependent physical quantities. However, dimensionless constants cannot be obtained by this method. The method of dimensions can only test the dimensional validity, but not the exact relationship between physical quantities in any equation. It does not distinguish between the physical quantities having same dimensions.\nA number of exercises at the end of this chapter will help you develop skill in dimensional analysis.",

Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly standardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela). The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units.\n3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a combination of the base units and are called derived units. A complete set of units, both fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.\n4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present internationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.\n5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and the derived quantities obtained from them. Certain derived units are expressed by means of Sl units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).\n6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m for metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).\n7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific notation, with powers of 10.

    "question": "Explain the concept of SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION",
    "answer": "In the earlier chapters we primarily considered the motion of a single particle. A particle is ideally represented as a point mass having no size. We applied the results of our study even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming that motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the motion of a particle. Any real body which we encounter in daily life has a finite size. In dealing with the motion of extended bodies (bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is inadequate. In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this inadequacy. We shall attempt to build an understanding of the motion of extended bodies. An extended body, in the first place, is a system of particles. We shall begin with the consideration of motion of the system as a whole. The centre of mass of a system of particles will be a key concept here. We shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system of particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding the motion of extended bodies. A large class of problems with extended bodies can be solved by considering them to be rigid bodies. Ideally a rigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and unchanging shape. The distances between all pairs of particles of such a body do not change. It is evident from this definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid, since real bodies deform under the influence of forces. But in many situations the deformations are negligible. In a number of situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel beams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore that they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treat them as rigid.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of What kind of motion can a rigid body have?",
    "answer": "Let us try to explore this question by taking some examples of the motion of rigid bodies. Let us begin with a rectangular block sliding down an inclined plane without any sidewise movement. The block is taken as a rigid body. Its motion down the plane is such that all the particles of the body are moving together, i.e. they have the same velocity at any instant of time. The rigid body here is in pure translational motion. In pure translational motion at any instant of time, all particles of the body have the same velocity. Consider now the rolling motion of a solid metallic or wooden cylinder down the same inclined plane. The rigid body in this problem, namely the cylinder, shifts from the top to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus, seems to have translational motion. But as Fig. 6.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with the same velocity at any instant. The body, therefore, is not in pure translational motion. Its motion is translational plus 'something else.' In order to understand what this 'something else' is, let us take a rigid body so constrained that it cannot have translational motion. The most common way to constrain a rigid body so that it does not have translational motion is to fix it along a straight line. The only possible motion of such a rigid body is rotation. The line or fixed axis about which the body is rotating is its axis of rotation. If you look around, you will come across many examples of rotation about an axis, a ceiling fan, a potter's wheel, a giant wheel in a fair, a merry-go-round and so on. You may notice that in rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis, every particle of the body moves in a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis.

    "answer": "and so on. You may notice that in rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis, every particle of the body moves in a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis. Fig. 6.4 shows the rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed axis (the z-axis of the frame of reference). Note that the circles described by (P_1) and (P_2) may lie in different planes; both these planes, however, are perpendicular to the fixed axis. For any particle on the axis like (P_3), (r=0). Any such particle remains stationary while the body rotates. In some examples of rotation, however, the axis may not be fixed. A prominent example of this kind of rotation is a top spinning in place. We know from experience that the axis of such a spinning top moves around the vertical through its point of contact with the ground, sweeping out a cone. Another simple example of this kind of rotation is the oscillating table fan or a pedestal fan. You may have observed that the axis of rotation of such a fan has an oscillating (sidewise) movement in a horizontal plane about the vertical through the point at which the axis is pivoted. While the fan rotates and its axis moves sidewise, this point is fixed. Thus, in more general cases of rotation, one point and not one line, of the rigid body is fixed. In our study, however, we mostly deal with the simpler and special case of rotation in which one line (i.e. the axis) is fixed. The rolling motion of a cylinder down an inclined plane is a combination of rotation about a fixed axis and translation. The 'something else' in the case of rolling motion which we referred to earlier is rotational motion.

We shall take the line joining the two particles to be the x- axis. Let the distances of the two particles be (x_1) and (x_2) respectively from some origin O. Let (m_1) and (m_2) be respectively the masses of the two particles. The centre of mass of the system is that point C which is at a distance X from O, where X is given by: \n[ X=\\frac{m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} ] \nIn this equation, X can be regarded as the mass- weighted mean of (x_1) and (x_2). If we have n particles of masses (m_1, m_2, ... m_n) respectively, along a straight line taken as the x-axis, then by definition the position of the centre of the mass of the system of particles is given by: \n[ X=\\frac{m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}+...+m_{n}x_{n}}{m_{1}+m_{2}+...+m_{n}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}x_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}} = \\frac{\\sum m_{i}x_{i}}{M} ] \nwhere (M=\\sum m_{i}) is the total mass of the system.

Find the reaction forces of the wall and the floor. \n\n**Answer**\nThe ladder AB is 3 m long, its foot A is at distance $AC=1$ m from the wall. From Pythagoras theorem, $BC=2\\sqrt{2}$ m. The forces on the ladder are its weight W acting at its centre of gravity D, reaction forces $F_1$ and $F_2$ of the wall and the floor respectively. Force $F_1$ is perpendicular to the wall, since the wall is frictionless. Force $F_2$ is resolved into two components, the normal reaction N and the force of friction F. For translational equilibrium, taking the forces in the vertical direction gives $N-W=0$, and in the horizontal direction gives $F-F_1=0$. For rotational equilibrium, taking the moments of the forces about A, we have $BC~F_1 - AD~W = 0$, where D is the midpoint of the ladder. This simplifies to $2\\sqrt{2}F_{1}-(1/2)W=0$. Solving these equations gives $N=196.0~N$, $F_1=34.6~N$ and $F=34.6~N$. The total reaction force of the floor is $F_2=\\sqrt{F^2+N^2}\\approx199.0~N$.

The centre of mass moves as if all the mass of the system is concentrated at this point and all the external forces act at it.

    "answer": "Motion is common to everything in the universe. We walk, run and ride a bicycle. Even when we are sleeping, air moves into and out of our lungs and blood flows in arteries and veins. We see leaves falling from trees and water flowing down a dam. Automobiles and planes carry people from one place to the other. The earth rotates once every twenty-four hours and revolves round the sun once in a year. The sun itself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving within its local group of galaxies. Motion is change in position of an object with time. How does the position change with time? In this chapter, we shall learn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the concepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight line, also known as rectilinear motion. For the case of rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple equations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity. In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as point objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a reasonable duration of time. In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error. In Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without going into the causes of motion. What causes motion described in this chapter and the next chapter forms the subject matter of Chapter 4.",

    "answer": "The average velocity tells us how fast an object has been moving over a given time interval but does not tell us how fast it moves at different instants of time during that interval. For this, we define instantaneous velocity or simply velocity vat an instant t. The velocity at an instant is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval $\\Delta t$ becomes infinitesimally small. In other words, $v=lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$ $=\\frac{dx}{dt}$ (2.1a) where the symbol $\\Delta t\\rightarrow0$ stands for the operation of taking limit as $\\Delta t\\rightarrow0$ of the quantity on its right. In the language of calculus, the quantity on the right hand side of Eq. (2.1a) is the differential coefficient of x with respect to t and is denoted by $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ (see Appendix 2.1). It is the rate of change of position with respect to time. at that instant. We can use Eq. (2.la) for obtaining the value of velocity at an instant either graphically or numerically. Suppose that we want to obtain graphically the value of velocity at time $t=4$ 4s (point P) for the motion of the car represented in Fig.2.1 calculation. Let us take $\\Delta t=2$ s centred at $t=4$ s. Then, by the definition of the average velocity, the slope of line $P_{1}P_{2}$ (Fig. 2.1) gives the value of average velocity over the interval 3s to 5 s.

    "question": "Explain the concept of Acceleration",
    "answer": "The velocity of an object, in general, changes during its course of motion. How to describe this change? Should it be described as the rate of change in velocity with distance or with time? This was a problem even in Galileo's time. It was first thought that this change could be described by the rate of change of velocity with distance. But, through his studies of motion of freely falling objects and motion of objects on an inclined plane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change of velocity with time is a constant of motion for all objects in free fall. On the other hand, the change in velocity with distance is not constant - it decreases with the increasing distance of fall. This led to the concept of acceleration as the rate of change of velocity with time. The average acceleration a over a time interval is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time interval: $\\overline{a}=\\frac{v_{2}-v_{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$ (2.2) where $V_{2}$ and $V_{1}$ are the instantaneous velocities or simply velocities at time $t_{2}$ $t_{1}$. It is the average change of velocity per unit time. The SI unit of acceleration is $S^{-2}$. On a plot of velocity versus time, the average acceleration is the slope of the straight line connecting the points corresponding to (v₂, t₂) and $(V_{1},t_{1})$. Instantaneous acceleration is defined in the same way as the instantaneous velocity: $a=lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{dv}{dt}$ (2.3) The acceleration at an instant is the slope of the tangent to the $v-t$ curve at that instant.

Acceleration, therefore, may result from a change in speed (magnitude), a change in direction or changes in both. Like velocity, acceleration can also be positive. negative or zero. Position-time graphs for motion with positive, negative and zero acceleration are shown in Figs. 2.4 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. Note that the graph curves upward for positive acceleration: downward for negative acceleration and it is a straight line for zero acceleration. Although acceleration can vary with time. our study in this chapter will be restricted to motion with constant acceleration. In this case, the average acceleration equals the constant value of acceleration during the interval. If the velocity of an object is $V_{p}$ at t $=0$ and vat time t, we have or, $v=v_{0}+at$. An interesting feature of a velocity-time graph for any moving object is that the area under the curve represents the displacement over a given time interval. A general proof of this statement requires use of calculus. We can, however, see that it is true for the simple case of an object moving with constant velocity u. Its velocity-time graph is as shown in Fig. 2.4. The v-t curve is a straight line parallel to the time axis and the area under it between $t=0$ and $t=T$ is the area of the rectangle of height u and base T. Therefore, area $=u\\times T=$ uT which is the displacement in this time interval. How come in this case an area is equal to a distance? Think!

    "answer": "For uniformly accelerated motion, we can derive some simple equations that relate displacement (x), time taken (t), initial velocity $(v_{o})$, final velocity ( ) and acceleration (a). Equation (2.4) already obtained gives a relation between final and initial velocities vand $v_{o}$ of an object moving with uniform acceleration a: $v=v_{0}+at$ (2.4) This relation is graphically represented in Fig. 2.5. The area under this curve is: Area between instants 0 and $t=$ Area of triangle ABC + Area of rectangle OACD $=\\frac{1}{2}(\\nu-\\nu_{0})t+\\nu_{0}t$. As explained in the previous section, the area under v-t curve represents the displacement. Therefore, the displacement x of the object is: $x=\\frac{1}{2}(v-v_{0})t+v_{0}t$ But $v-v_{0}=at$. Therefore, $x=\\frac{1}{2}a~t^{2}+v_{0}t$ or, $x=v_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$ (2.5) Equation (2.5) can also be written as $x=\\frac{v+v_{0}}{2}t=\\overline{v}t$ (2.6) where, $\\overline{v}=\\frac{v+v_{0}}{2}$ (constant acceleration only) (2.7b) Equations (2.7a) and (2.7b) mean that the object has undergone displacement x with an average velocity equal to the arithmetic average of the initial and final velocities. From Eq. (2.4), $t=(v-v_{0})/a.$ Substituting this in Eq. (2.7a), we get $x=\\overline{v}t=(\\frac{v+v_{0}}{2})(\\frac{v-v_{0}}{a})=\\frac{v^{2}-v_{0}^{2}}{2a}$ $v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2ax$ (2.8) This equation can also be obtained by substituting the value of t from Eq.

    "question": "Explain the concept of Kinematic equations for uniformly accelerated motion",
    "answer": "**Answer**\n(a) Let us take the y-axis in the vertically upward direction with zero at the ground, as shown in Fig. 2.6. Now $v_{o}=+20ms^{-1}$, $a=-g=-10~m~s^{-2}$, $v=0~m~s^{-1}$. If the ball rises to height y from the point of launch, then using the equation $v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2a(y-y_{0})$ we get $0=(20)^{2}+2(-10)(y-y_{0})$. Solving, we get. $(y-y_{0})=20$ m.\n(b) We can solve this part of the problem in two ways. Note carefully the methods used. FIRST METHOD: In the first method, we split the path in two parts: the upward motion (A to B) and the downward motion (B to C) and calculate the corresponding time taken $t_{i}$ and $t_{2}.$ Since the velocity at B is zero, we have: $v=v_{0}+at$ Or, $0=20-10t_{1}$ $t_{1}=2$ s. This is the time in going from A to B. From B, or the point of the maximum height, the ball falls freely under the acceleration due to gravity. The ball is moving in negative y direction. We use equation $y=y_{0}+v_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$. We have, $y_{0}=45m.$ $y=0,$ $v_{0}=0$ $a=-g=-10ms^{-2}$. $0=45+(\\frac{1}{2})(-10)t^{2}$. Solving, we get $t_{2}=3$ s. Therefore, the total time taken by the ball before it hits the ground $=t_{1}+t_{2}=2~s+3~s=5~s$. SECOND METHOD: The total time taken can also be calculated by noting the coordinates of initial and final positions of the ball with respect to the origin chosen and using equation $y=y_{0}+v_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$. Now $y_{0}=25~m$ $y=0~m$. $v_{o}=20ms^{-1}$, $a=-10m~s^{-2}$, $t=?$. $0=25+20t+(\\frac{1}{2})$ (-10) t². Or. $5t^{2}-20t-25=0$. Solving this quadratic equation for t, we get $t=5s$. Note that the second method is better since we do not have to worry about the path of the motion as the motion is under constant acceleration.",

    "answer": "Example 2.4\nFree-fall Discuss the motion of an object under free fall. Neglect air resistance.\n\n**Answer**\nAn object released near the surface of the Earth is accelerated downward under the influence of the force of gravity. The magnitude of acceleration due to gravity is represented by g. If air resistance is neglected, the object is said to be in free fall. If the height through which the object falls is small compared to the earth's radius, g can be taken to be constant, equal to $9.8~m~s^{-2}$ Free fall is thus a case of motion with uniform acceleration. We assume that the motion is in y-direction, more correctly in-y-direction because we choose upward direction as positive. Since the acceleration due to gravity is always downward, it is in the negative direction and we have $a=-g=-9.8~m~s^{-2}$. The object is released from rest at $y=0$ Therefore, $v_{0}=0$ and the equations of motion become: $v=0-gt=-9.8~t$ ms¹. $y=0-\\frac{1}{2}g~t^{2}=-4.9~t^{2}$ $v^{2}=0-2~g~y=-19.6~y$ $m^{2}s^{-2}$. These equations give the velocity and the distance travelled as a function of time and also the variation of velocity with distance.

    "answer": "1. An object is said to be in motion if its position changes with time. The position of the object can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin. For motion in a straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as negative.\n2. The average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval.\n3. Instantaneous velocity or simply velocity is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval $\\Delta t$ becomes infinitesimally small : $v=lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\overline{v}=lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{dx}{d~t}$. The velocity at a particular instant is equal to the slope of the tangent drawn on position-time graph at that instant.\n4. Average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time interval during which the change occurs: $\\overline{a}=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$.\n5. Instantaneous acceleration is defined as the limit of the average acceleration as the time interval $\\Delta t$ goes to zero: $a=lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\overline{a}=lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{dv}{dt}$. The acceleration of an object at a particular time is the slope of the velocity-time graph at that instant of time.\n6. For uniform motion, acceleration is zero and the $x-t$ graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis and the v-t graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis. For motion with uniform acceleration, $x-t$ graph is a parabola while the v-t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis.\n7.

    "answer": "The terms 'work', 'energy' and 'power' are frequently used in everyday language. A farmer ploughing the field, a construction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for a competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful landscape, all are said to be working. In physics, however, the word 'Work' covers a definite and precise meaning. Somebody who has the capacity to work for 14-16 hours a day is said to have a large stamina or energy. We admire a long distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is thus our capacity to do work. In Physics too, the term 'energy' is related to work in this sense, but as said above the term 'work' itself is defined much more precisely. The word 'power' is used in everyday life with different shades of meaning. In karate or boxing we talk of 'powerful' punches. These are delivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to the meaning of the word 'power' used in physics. We shall find that there is at best a loose correlation between the physical definitions and the physiological pictures these terms generate in our minds. The aim of this chapter is to develop an understanding of these three physical quantities. Before we proceed to this task, we need to develop a mathematical prerequisite, namely the scalar product of two vectors.",

There are two ways of multiplying vectors which we shall come across: one way known as the scalar product gives a scalar from two vectors and the other known as the vector product produces a new vector from two vectors. The scalar product or dot product of any two vectors A and B, denoted as (A cdot B) is defined as: \n[ A \\cdot B=A B \\cos \\theta \\] \nwhere (\\theta) is the angle between the two vectors. Since A, B and \\(cos \\theta\\) are scalars, the dot product of A and B is a scalar quantity. Each vector, A and B, has a direction but their scalar product does not have a direction.

    "answer": "(A \\cdot B=A(B \\cos \\theta) = B(A \\cos \\theta)) \nGeometrically, (B \\cos \\theta) is the projection of B onto A and (A \\cos \\theta) is the projection of A onto B. So, (A \\cdot B) is the product of the magnitude of A and the component of B along A. Alternatively, it is the product of the magnitude of B and the component of A along B. The scalar product follows the commutative law: (A \\cdot B=B \\cdot A). Scalar product obeys the distributive law: (A \\cdot(B+C)=A \\cdot B+A \\cdot C). Further, (A \\cdot(\\lambda B)=\\lambda(A \\cdot B)) where (\\lambda) is a real number.

Taking potential energy as zero at A, the energy at A is (E_A=\\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2). At the highest point C, the tension (T_C=0), so from Newton's second law, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force: (mg=\\frac{mv_C^2}{L}). The energy at C is (E_C=\\frac{1}{2}mv_C^2+2mgL). By conservation of energy, (E_A=E_C), which gives (v_0=\\sqrt{5gL}). \n(ii) From the tension equation at C, (v_C=\\sqrt{gL}). At point B, the energy is (E_B=\\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2+mgL). Equating this to (E_A), we get (v_B=\\sqrt{3gL}). \n(iii) The ratio of kinetic energies is (\\frac{K_B}{K_C}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}mv_B^2}{\\frac{1}{2}mv_C^2}=\\frac{3gL}{gL}=3). \nAfter the string breaks at C, the bob will undergo projectile motion with a horizontal projection.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Collisions",
    "answer": "Example 5.12\nConsider the collision of two billiard balls with equal masses ($m_1=m_2$). The first ball (cue) strikes the second ball (target) which is at rest. The player wants to 'sink' the target ball in a corner pocket at an angle $\\theta_2=37^{\\circ}$. Assuming an elastic collision and that friction and rotational motion are negligible, obtain $\\theta_1$.\n\n**Answer**\nFrom momentum conservation, (v_{1i}=v_{1f}+v_{2f}) since (m_1=m_2). Squaring this gives (v_{1i}^2=v_{1f}^2+v_{2f}^2+2v_{1f}v_{2f}\\cos(\\theta_1+\\theta_2)). From conservation of kinetic energy for an elastic collision, (v_{1i}^2=v_{1f}^2+v_{2f}^2). Comparing these two equations, we find that (2v_{1f}v_{2f}\\cos(\\theta_1+\\theta_2)=0). Since the velocities are non-zero, this implies (\\cos(\\theta_1+\\theta_2)=0), so (\\theta_1+\\theta_2=90^{\\circ}). Given (\\theta_2=37^{\\circ}), we find (\\theta_1=53^{\\circ}). This proves that for a glancing elastic collision between two equal masses, one initially at rest, they will move at right angles to each other after the collision.",

    "answer": "1. The work-energy theorem states that the change in kinetic energy of a body is the work done by the net force on the body: (K_f-K_i=W_{net}).\n2. A force is conservative if the work it does is path-independent, or if the work done over a closed loop is zero. For a conservative force in one dimension, a potential energy function (V(x)) can be defined such that (F(x)=-\\frac{dV(x)}{dx}).\n3. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical energy ((E=K+V)) of a body remains constant if the only forces doing work on it are conservative.\n4. The gravitational potential energy of a particle of mass m at height x is (V(x)=mgx). The elastic potential energy of a spring with force constant k and extension x is (V(x)=\\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}).\n5. The scalar or dot product of two vectors A and B is a scalar quantity defined as (A\\cdot B=AB\\cos\\theta). The scalar product of unit vectors is: (\\hat{i}\\cdot\\hat{i}=\\hat{j}\\cdot\\hat{j}=\\hat{k}\\cdot\\hat{k}=1) and (\\hat{i}\\cdot\\hat{j}=\\hat{j}\\cdot\\hat{k}=\\hat{k}\\cdot\\hat{i}=0).\n6. Power is the rate at which work is done, (P=\\frac{dW}{dt}), and can be expressed as the dot product of force and velocity, (P=F\\cdot v). Its SI unit is the watt (W).\n7. In all collisions, total linear momentum is conserved. In an elastic collision, total kinetic energy is also conserved. In a completely inelastic collision, the two bodies stick together.",
