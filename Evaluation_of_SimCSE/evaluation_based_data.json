    "answer": "Measurement of any physical quantity involves comparison with a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen, internationally accepted reference standard called unit. The result of a measurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a number (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit. Although the number of physical quantities appears to be very large, we need only a limited number of units for expressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter- related with one another. The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units. The units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the derived quantities are called derived units. A complete set of these units, both the base units and derived units, is known as the system of units.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of The International System of Units",
    "answer": "In earlier time scientists of different countries were using different systems of units for measurement. Three such systems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS system were in use extensively till recently. The base units for length, mass and time in these systems were as follows: In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second respectively. In FPS system they were foot, pound and second respectively. In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second respectively. The system of units which is at present internationally accepted for measurement is the Système Internationale d' Unites (French for International System of Units), abbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols, units and abbreviations, developed by the Bureau International des Poids et measures (The International Bureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM) in 1971 were recently revised by the General Conference on Weights and Measures in November 2018. The scheme is now for international usage in scientific, technical, industrial and commercial work. Because SI units used decimal system, conversions within the system are quite simple and convenient. We shall follow the SI units in this book. In SI, there are seven base units as given in Table 1.1. Besides the seven base units, there are two more units that are defined for (a) plane angle $d\\theta$ as the ratio of length of arc ds to the radius r and (b) solid angle $d\\Omega$ as the ratio of the intercepted area dA of the spherical surface, described about the apex O as the centre, to the square of its radius r, as shown in Fig. 1.1(a) and (b) respectively. The unit for plane angle is radian with the symbol rad and the unit for the solid angle is steradian with the symbol sr. Both these are dimensionless quantities.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Significant Figures",
    "answer": "Note that when mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified. These entities may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles or specified groups of such particles. We employ units for some physical quantities that can be derived from the seven base units (Appendix A 6). Some derived units in terms of the SI base units are given in (Appendix A 6.1). Some SI derived units are given special names (Appendix A 6.2) and some derived SI units make use of these units with special names and the seven base units (Appendix A 6.3). These are given in Appendix A 6.2 and A 6.3 for your ready reference. Other units retained for general use are given in Table 1.2. Common SI prefixes and symbols for multiples and sub-multiples are given in Appendix A2. General guidelines for using symbols for physical quantities, chemical elements and nuclides are given in Appendix A7 and those for SI units and some other units are given in Appendix A8 for your guidance and ready reference. As discussed above, every measurement involves errors. Thus, the result of measurement should be reported in a way that indicates the precision of measurement. Normally, the reported result of measurement is a number that includes all digits in the number that are known reliably plus the first digit that is uncertain. The reliable digits plus the first uncertain digit are known as significant digits or significant figures. If we say the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are reliable and certain, while the digit 2 is uncertain. Thus, the measured value has three significant figures. The length of an object reported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly, reporting the result of measurement that includes more digits than the significant digits is superfluous and also misleading since it would give a wrong idea about the precision of measurement. The rules for determining the number of significant figures can be understood from the following examples. Significant figures indicate, as already mentioned, the precision of measurement which depends on the least count of the measuring instrument. A choice of change of different units does not change the number of significant digits or figures in a measurement. This important remark makes most of the following observations clear: (1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four significant figures. But in different units, the same value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08 mm or $23080~\\mu m$. All these numbers have the same number of significant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four.",

  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of Rules for Significant Figures",
    "answer": "This shows that the location of decimal point is of no consequence in determining the number of significant figures. The example gives the following rules:\nAll the non-zero digits are significant.\nAll the zeros between two non-zero digits are significant, no matter where the decimal point is, if at all.\nIf the number is less than 1, the zero(s) on the right of decimal point but to the left of the first non-zero digit are not significant. [In 0.00 2308, the underlined zeroes are not significant].\nThe terminal or trailing zero(s) in a number without a decimal point are not significant. [Thus $123~m=12300~cm=123000$ mm has three significant figures, the trailing zero(s) being not significant.] However, you can also see the next observation.\nThe trailing zero(s) in a number with a decimal point are significant. [The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four significant figures each.]\n(2) There can be some confusion regarding the trailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to be 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here are meant to convey the precision of measurement and are, therefore, significant. [If these were not, it would be superfluous to write them explicitly, the reported measurement would have been simply 4.7 ml. Now suppose we change units, then $4.700~m=470.0~cm=4700~mm=0.004700~km$. Since the last number has trailing zero(s) in a number with no decimal, we would conclude erroneously from observation (1) above that the number has two significant figures, while in fact, it has four significant figures and a mere change of units cannot change the number of significant figures.\n(3) To remove such ambiguities in determining the number of significant figures, the best way is to report every measurement in scientific notation (in the power of 10). In this notation, every number is expressed as $a\\times10^{b}$ where a is a number between 1 and 10, and b is any positive or negative exponent (or power) of 10. In order to get an approximate idea of the number, we may round off the number a to 1 (for $a\\le5$) and to 10 (for $5<a\\le10)$. Then the number can be expressed approximately as $10^{b}$ in which the exponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of magnitude of the physical quantity. When only an estimate is required, the quantity is of the order of $10^{b}$ For example, the diameter of the earth $(1.28\\times10^{7}m)$ is of the order of $10^{7}m$ with the order of magnitude 7. The diameter of hydrogen atom $(1.06\\times10^{-10}m)$ is of the order of $10^{-10}m$, with the order of magnitude -10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders of magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom. It is often customary to write the decimal after the first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in (a) above disappears : $4.700~m=4.700\\times10^{2}cm =4.700\\times10^{3}mm=4.700\\times10^{-3}km$. The power of 10 is irrelevant to the determination of significant figures. However, all zeroes appearing in the base number in the scientific notation are significant. Each number in this case has four significant figures. Thus, in the scientific notation, no confusion arises about the trailing zero(s) in the base number a. They are always significant.\n(4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting measurement. But if this is not adopted, we use the rules adopted in the preceding example : For a number greater than 1, without any decimal, the trailing zero(s) are not significant. For a number with a decimal, the trailing zero(s) are significant.\n(5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a decimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250) is never significant. However, the zeroes at the end of such number are significant in a measurement.\n(6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are neither rounded numbers nor numbers representing measured values are exact and have infinite number of significant digits. For example in $r=\\frac{d}{2}$ or $s=2\\pi r$ the factor 2 is an exact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00 or 2.0000 as required. Similarly, in $T=\\frac{t}{n}$, n is an exact number.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Rules for Arithmetic Operations with Significant Figures",
    "answer": "The result of a calculation involving approximate measured values of quantities (i.e. values with limited number of significant figures) must reflect the uncertainties in the original measured values. It cannot be more accurate than the original measured values themselves on which the result is based. In general, the final result should not have more significant figures than the original data from which it was obtained. Thus, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be $2.51~cm^{3}$ then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is $1.68804780876~g/cm^{3}$ upto 11 decimal places. It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant to record the calculated value of density to such a precision when the measurements on which the value is based, have much less precision. The following rules for arithmetic operations with significant figures ensure that the final result of a calculation is shown with the precision that is consistent with the precision of the input measured values:\n(1) In multiplication or division, the final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures. Thus, in the example above, density should be reported to three significant figures. Density = $\\frac{4.237g}{2.51~cm^{3}}=1.69~g~cm^{-3}$. Similarly, if the speed of light is given as $3.00\\times10^{8}$ m $S^{-1}$ (three significant figure) and one year ( $(1y=365.25~d)$ has $3.1557\\times10^{7}s$ (five significant figures), the light year is $9.47\\times10^{15}n$ (three significant figures).\n(2) In addition or subtraction, the final result should retain as many decimal places as are there in the number with the least decimal places. For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic addition, is 663.821 g. But the least precise measurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one decimal place. The final result should, therefore, be rounded off to 663.8 g. Similarly, the difference in length can be expressed as: $0.307~m-0.304~m = 0.003~m = 3\\times10^{-3}~m$. Note that we should not use the rule (1) applicable for multiplication and division and write 664 g as the result in the example of addition and $3.00\\times10^{-3}$ m in the example of subtraction. They do not convey the precision of measurement properly. For addition and subtraction, the rule is in terms of decimal places.",

    "answer": "The result of computation with approximate numbers, which contain more than one uncertain digit, should be rounded off. The rules for rounding off numbers to the appropriate significant figures are obvious in most cases. A number 2.746 rounded off to three significant figures is 2.75, while the number 1.743 would be 1.74. The rule by convention is that the preceding digit is raised by 1 if the insignificant digit to be dropped (the underlined digit in this case) is more than 5, and is left unchanged if the latter is less than 5. But what if the number is 2.745 in which the insignificant digit is 5. Here, the convention is that if the preceding digit is even, the insignificant digit is simply dropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit is raised by 1. Then, the number 2.745 rounded off to three significant figures becomes 1.74. On the other hand, the number 2.735 rounded off to three significant figures becomes 1.74 since the preceding digit is odd. In any involved or complex multi-step calculation, you should retain, in intermediate steps, one digit more than the significant digits and round off to proper significant figures at the end of the calculation. Similarly, a number known to be within many significant figures, such as in $2.99792458\\times10^{8}m/s$ for the speed of light in vacuum, is rounded off to an approximate value $3\\times10^{8}m/s$, which is often employed in computations.

    "answer": "The rules for determining the uncertainty or error in the number/measured quantity in arithmetic operations can be understood from the following examples.\n(1) If the length and breadth of a thin rectangular sheet are measured, using a metre scale as 16.2 cm and, 10.1 cm respectively, there are three significant figures in each measurement. It means that the length may be written as $16.2 \\pm 0.1~cm$ $=16.2~cm\\pm0.6\\%$. Similarly, the breadth b may be written as $b=10.1\\pm0.1~cm$ $=10.1~cm\\pm1\\%$. Then, the error of the product of two (or more) experimental values, using the combination of errors rule, will be $I~b=163.62~cm^{2}\\pm1.6\\%$ $=163.62+2.6~cm^{2}$. This leads us to quote the final result as $1b164+3~cm^{2}$. Here $3~cm^{2}$ is the uncertainty or error in the estimation of area of rectangular sheet.\n(2) If a set of experimental data is specified to n significant figures, a result obtained by combining the data will also be valid to n significant figures. However, if data are subtracted, the number of significant figures can be reduced. For example, 12.9 g - 7.06 g. both specified to three significant figures, cannot properly be evaluated as 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as uncertainties in subtraction or addition combine in a different fashion (smallest number of decimal places rather than the number of significant figures in any of the number added or subtracted).\n(3) The relative error of a value of number specified to significant figures depends not only on n but also on the number itself. For example, the accuracy in measurement of mass 1.02 g is $\\pm0.01$ g whereas another measurement 9.89 g is also accurate to $\\pm0.01$ g. The relative error in 1.02 g is $=(\\pm0.01/1.02)\\times100\\%$ $=\\pm1\\%$. Similarly, the relative error in 9.89 g is $=(\\pm0.01/9.89)\\times100\\%$ $=\\pm0.1\\%$.\nFinally, remember that intermediate results in a multi-step computation should be calculated to one more significant figure in every measurement than the number of digits in the least precise measurement. These should be justified by the data and then the arithmetic operations may be carried out; otherwise rounding errors can build up. For example, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after rounding off) to the same number of significant figures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of 0.104 calculated to three significant figures is 9.62. However, if we had written $1/9.58=0.1044$ and then taken the reciprocal to three significant figures, we would have retrieved the original value of 9.58. This example justifies the idea to retain one more extra digit (than the number of digits in the least precise measurement) in intermediate steps of the complex multi-step calculations in order to avoid additional errors in the process of rounding off the numbers.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Dimensions of Physical Quantities",
    "answer": "The nature of a physical quantity is described by its dimensions. All the physical quantities represented by derived units can be expressed in terms of some combination of seven fundamental or base quantities. We shall call these base quantities as the seven dimensions of the physical world, which are denoted with square brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the dimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current [A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous intensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol]. The dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers (or exponents) to which the base quantities are raised to represent that quantity. Note that using the square brackets [ ] around a quantity means that we are dealing with 'the dimensions of the quantity. In mechanics, all the physical quantities can be written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M] and [T]. For example, the volume occupied by an object is expressed as the product of length, breadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the dimensions of volume are $[L]\\times[L]\\times[L]=[L]^{3}=[L^{3}]$. As the volume is independent of mass and time, it is said to possess zero dimension in mass [$M^{0}$], zero dimension in time [$T^{0}$] and three dimensions in length. Similarly, force, as the product of mass and acceleration, can be expressed as Force = mass x acceleration = mass $\\times$ (length)/(time)². The dimensions of force are [M] $[L]/[T]^{2}=[MLT^{-2}]$. Thus, the force has one dimension in mass, one dimension in length, and -2 dimensions in time. The dimensions in all other base quantities are zero. Note that in this type of representation, the magnitudes are not considered. It is the quality of the type of the physical quantity that enters. Thus, a change in velocity, initial velocity, average velocity, final velocity, and speed are all equivalent in this context. Since all these quantities can be expressed as length/time, their dimensions are [L]/[T] or $[L~T^{-1}]$.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Dimensional Formulae and Dimensional Equations",
    "answer": "The expression which shows how and which of the base quantities represent the dimensions of a physical quantity is called the dimensional formula of the given physical quantity. For example, the dimensional formula of the volume is $[M^{0}L^{3}T^{0}]$, and that of speed or velocity is $[M^{0}LT^{-1}]$. Similarly, $[M^{0}LT^{-2}]$ is the dimensional formula of acceleration and [M $L^{-3}$ $T^{0}$] that of mass density. An equation obtained by equating a physical quantity with its dimensional formula is called the dimensional equation of the physical quantity. Thus, the dimensional equations are the equations, which represent the dimensions of a physical quantity in terms of the base quantities. For example, the dimensional equations of volume [V], speed [u], force [F] and mass density [ρ] may be expressed as $[V]=[M^{0}L^{3}T^{0}]$ $[v]=[M^{0}L~T^{-1}]$ $[F]=[ML~T^{-2}]$ $[ρ]=[M~L^{-3}T^{0}]$. The dimensional equation can be obtained from the equation representing the relations between the physical quantities.

  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of Checking the Dimensional Consistency of Equations",
    "answer": "The magnitudes of physical quantities may be added together or subtracted from one another only if they have the same dimensions. In other words, we can add or subtract similar physical quantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to force, or an electric current cannot be subtracted from the thermodynamic temperature. This simple principle called the principle of homogeneity of dimensions in an equation is extremely useful in checking the correctness of an equation. If the dimensions of all the terms are not same, the equation is wrong. Hence, if we derive an expression for the length (or distance) of an object, regardless of the symbols appearing in the original mathematical relation, when all the individual dimensions are simplified, the remaining dimension must be that of length. Similarly, if we derive an equation of speed, the dimensions on both the sides of equation, when simplified, must be of length/ time, or $[L~T^{-1}]$. Dimensions are customarily used as a preliminary test of the consistency of an equation, when there is some doubt about the correctness of the equation. However, the dimensional consistency does not guarantee correct equations. It is uncertain to the extent of dimensionless quantities or functions. The arguments of special functions, such as the trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions must be dimensionless. A pure number, ratio of similar physical quantities, such as angle as the ratio (length/length), refractive index as the ratio (speed of light in vacuum/speed of light in medium) etc., has no dimensions. Now we can test the dimensional consistency or homogeneity of the equation $x=x_{0}+v_{0}t+(1/2)at^{2}$ for the distance x travelled by a particle or body in time t which starts from the position $x_{0}$ with an initial velocity $v_{0}$ at time $t=0$ and has uniform acceleration a along the direction of motion. The dimensions of each term may be written as $[x]=[L]$ $[x_{0}]=[L]$ $[v_{0}t]=[L~T^{-1}][T] = [L]$ $[(1/2)a~t^{2}]=[L~T^{-2}][T^{2}]$ = [L]. As each term on the right hand side of this equation has the same dimension, namely that of length, which is same as the dimension of left hand side of the equation, hence this equation is a dimensionally correct equation. It may be noted that a test of consistency of dimensions tells us no more and no less than a test of consistency of units, but has the advantage that we need not commit ourselves to a particular choice of units, and we need not worry about conversions among multiples and sub-multiples of the units. It may be borne in mind that if an equation fails this consistency test, it is proved wrong, but if it passes, it is not proved right. Thus, a dimensionally correct equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong (incorrect) or inconsistent equation must be wrong.",

    "answer": "Example 1.5\nConsider a simple pendulum, having a bob attached to a string, that oscillates under the action of the force of gravity. Suppose that the period of oscillation of the simple pendulum depends on its length (l), mass of the bob (m) and acceleration due to gravity (g). Derive the expression for its time period using method of dimensions.\n\n**Answer**\nThe dependence of time period T on the quantities l, g and m as a product may be written as: $T=k~l^{x}~g^{y}~m^{z}$ where k is dimensionless constant and x, y and z are the exponents.\nBy considering dimensions on both sides, we have $[L^{0}M^{0}T^{1}]=[L^{1}]^{x}[L^{1}T^{-2}]^{y}[M^{1}]^{z}$ $=L^{x} T^{-2y} M^{z}$.\nOn equating the dimensions on both sides, we have $x+y=0;-2y=1$; and $z=0$.\nSo that $y=-1/2$, $x=1/2$, $z=0$.\nThen, $T=k~l^{\\frac{1}{2}}g^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ or, $T=k\\sqrt{\\frac{l}{g}}$.\nNote that value of constant k can not be obtained by the method of dimensions. Here it does not matter if some number multiplies the right side of this formula, because that does not affect its dimensions. Actually, $k=2\\pi$ so that $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{l}{g}}$.\nDimensional analysis is very useful in deducing relations among the interdependent physical quantities. However, dimensionless constants cannot be obtained by this method. The method of dimensions can only test the dimensional validity, but not the exact relationship between physical quantities in any equation. It does not distinguish between the physical quantities having same dimensions.\nA number of exercises at the end of this chapter will help you develop skill in dimensional analysis.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of SUMMARY OF UNITS AND MEASUREMENT",
    "answer": "1. Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities. Certain physical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity).\n2. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly standardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela). The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units.\n3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a combination of the base units and are called derived units. A complete set of units, both fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.\n4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present internationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.\n5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and the derived quantities obtained from them. Certain derived units are expressed by means of Sl units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).\n6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m for metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).\n7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific notation, with powers of 10. Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify measurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision of the numbers.\n8. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical quantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for expressing properly the physical quantities and measurements.\n9. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the relationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired units are obtained.\n10. In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained. Rules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic operations with them, and 'rounding off the uncertain digits must be followed.\n11. The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe the nature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the dimensional consistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical quantities, etc.. A dimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation. but a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation must be wrong.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of MOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE",
    "answer": "Motion is common to everything in the universe. We walk, run and ride a bicycle. Even when we are sleeping, air moves into and out of our lungs and blood flows in arteries and veins. We see leaves falling from trees and water flowing down a dam. Automobiles and planes carry people from one place to the other. The earth rotates once every twenty-four hours and revolves round the sun once in a year. The sun itself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving within its local group of galaxies. Motion is change in position of an object with time. How does the position change with time? In this chapter, we shall learn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the concepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight line, also known as rectilinear motion. For the case of rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple equations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity. In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as point objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a reasonable duration of time. In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error. In Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without going into the causes of motion. What causes motion described in this chapter and the next chapter forms the subject matter of Chapter 4.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Instantaneous Velocity and Speed",
    "answer": "The average velocity tells us how fast an object has been moving over a given time interval but does not tell us how fast it moves at different instants of time during that interval. For this, we define instantaneous velocity or simply velocity vat an instant t. The velocity at an instant is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval $\\Delta t$ becomes infinitesimally small. In other words, $v=lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$ $=\\frac{dx}{dt}$ (2.1a) where the symbol $\\Delta t\\rightarrow0$ stands for the operation of taking limit as $\\Delta t\\rightarrow0$ of the quantity on its right. In the language of calculus, the quantity on the right hand side of Eq. (2.1a) is the differential coefficient of x with respect to t and is denoted by $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ (see Appendix 2.1). It is the rate of change of position with respect to time. at that instant. We can use Eq. (2.la) for obtaining the value of velocity at an instant either graphically or numerically. Suppose that we want to obtain graphically the value of velocity at time $t=4$ 4s (point P) for the motion of the car represented in Fig.2.1 calculation. Let us take $\\Delta t=2$ s centred at $t=4$ s. Then, by the definition of the average velocity, the slope of line $P_{1}P_{2}$ (Fig. 2.1) gives the value of average velocity over the interval 3s to 5 s. We see from Table 2.1 that as we decrease the value of $\\Delta t$ from 2.0 s to 0.010 s, the value of the average velocity approaches the limiting value 3.84 m $S^{-1}$ which is the value of velocity at $t=4.0$ s, i.e. the value of $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ at $t=4.0$ s. In this manner, we can calculate velocity at each instant for motion of the car. The graphical method for the determination of the instantaneous velocity is always not a convenient method. For this, we must carefully plot the position-time graph and calculate the value of average velocity as $\\Delta t$ becomes smaller and smaller. It is easier to calculate the value of velocity at different instants if we have data of positions at different instants or exact expression for the position as a function of time. Then, we calculate $\\Delta x/\\Delta t$ from the data for decreasing the value of $\\Delta t$ and find the limiting value as we have done in Table 2.1 or use differential calculus for the given expression and calculate $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ at different instants as done in the following example. Instantaneous speed or simply speed is the magnitude of velocity. For example, a velocity of + 24.0 m $s^{-1}$ and a velocity of 24.0 m $s^{-1}-$ both have an associated speed of 24.0 m $S^{-1}.$ It should be noted that though average speed over a finite interval of time is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity. instantaneous speed at an instant is equal to the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity at that instant.

    "question": "Explain the concept of Acceleration",
    "answer": "The velocity of an object, in general, changes during its course of motion. How to describe this change? Should it be described as the rate of change in velocity with distance or with time? This was a problem even in Galileo's time. It was first thought that this change could be described by the rate of change of velocity with distance. But, through his studies of motion of freely falling objects and motion of objects on an inclined plane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change of velocity with time is a constant of motion for all objects in free fall. On the other hand, the change in velocity with distance is not constant - it decreases with the increasing distance of fall. This led to the concept of acceleration as the rate of change of velocity with time. The average acceleration a over a time interval is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time interval: $\\overline{a}=\\frac{v_{2}-v_{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$ (2.2) where $V_{2}$ and $V_{1}$ are the instantaneous velocities or simply velocities at time $t_{2}$ $t_{1}$. It is the average change of velocity per unit time. The SI unit of acceleration is $S^{-2}$. On a plot of velocity versus time, the average acceleration is the slope of the straight line connecting the points corresponding to (v₂, t₂) and $(V_{1},t_{1})$. Instantaneous acceleration is defined in the same way as the instantaneous velocity: $a=lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{dv}{dt}$ (2.3) The acceleration at an instant is the slope of the tangent to the $v-t$ curve at that instant. Since velocity is a quantity having both magnitude and direction, a change in velocity may involve either or both of these factors. Acceleration, therefore, may result from a change in speed (magnitude), a change in direction or changes in both. Like velocity, acceleration can also be positive. negative or zero. Position-time graphs for motion with positive, negative and zero acceleration are shown in Figs. 2.4 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. Note that the graph curves upward for positive acceleration: downward for negative acceleration and it is a straight line for zero acceleration. Although acceleration can vary with time. our study in this chapter will be restricted to motion with constant acceleration. In this case, the average acceleration equals the constant value of acceleration during the interval. If the velocity of an object is $V_{p}$ at t $=0$ and vat time t, we have or, $v=v_{0}+at$. An interesting feature of a velocity-time graph for any moving object is that the area under the curve represents the displacement over a given time interval. A general proof of this statement requires use of calculus. We can, however, see that it is true for the simple case of an object moving with constant velocity u. Its velocity-time graph is as shown in Fig. 2.4. The v-t curve is a straight line parallel to the time axis and the area under it between $t=0$ and $t=T$ is the area of the rectangle of height u and base T. Therefore, area $=u\\times T=$ uT which is the displacement in this time interval. How come in this case an area is equal to a distance? Think! Note the dimensions of quantities on the two coordinate axes, and you will arrive at the answer. Note that the x-t, v-t, and a-t graphs shown in several figures in this chapter have sharp kinks at some points implying that the functions are not differentiable at these points. In any realistic situation, the functions will be differentiable at all points and the graphs will be smooth. What this means physically is that acceleration and velocity cannot change values abruptly at an instant. Changes are always continuous.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Kinematic equations for uniformly accelerated motion",
    "answer": "For uniformly accelerated motion, we can derive some simple equations that relate displacement (x), time taken (t), initial velocity $(v_{o})$, final velocity ( ) and acceleration (a). Equation (2.4) already obtained gives a relation between final and initial velocities vand $v_{o}$ of an object moving with uniform acceleration a: $v=v_{0}+at$ (2.4) This relation is graphically represented in Fig. 2.5. The area under this curve is: Area between instants 0 and $t=$ Area of triangle ABC + Area of rectangle OACD $=\\frac{1}{2}(\\nu-\\nu_{0})t+\\nu_{0}t$. As explained in the previous section, the area under v-t curve represents the displacement. Therefore, the displacement x of the object is: $x=\\frac{1}{2}(v-v_{0})t+v_{0}t$ But $v-v_{0}=at$. Therefore, $x=\\frac{1}{2}a~t^{2}+v_{0}t$ or, $x=v_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$ (2.5) Equation (2.5) can also be written as $x=\\frac{v+v_{0}}{2}t=\\overline{v}t$ (2.6) where, $\\overline{v}=\\frac{v+v_{0}}{2}$ (constant acceleration only) (2.7b) Equations (2.7a) and (2.7b) mean that the object has undergone displacement x with an average velocity equal to the arithmetic average of the initial and final velocities. From Eq. (2.4), $t=(v-v_{0})/a.$ Substituting this in Eq. (2.7a), we get $x=\\overline{v}t=(\\frac{v+v_{0}}{2})(\\frac{v-v_{0}}{a})=\\frac{v^{2}-v_{0}^{2}}{2a}$ $v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2ax$ (2.8) This equation can also be obtained by substituting the value of t from Eq. (2.4) into Eq. (2.6). Thus, we have obtained three important equations: $v=v_{0}+at$ (2.9a) $x=v_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$ $v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2ax$ connecting five quantities v, a, tand x. These are kinematic equations of rectilinear motion for constant acceleration. The set of Eq. (2.9a) were obtained by assuming that at $t=0$, the position of the particle. xis 0. We can obtain a more general equation if we take the position coordinate at $t=0$ as non- zero, say $x_{0}$. Then Eqs. (2.9a) are modified (replacing x by $x-x_{0}$ to: $v=v_{0}+at$ (2.9b) $x=x_{0}+v_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$ (2.9c) $v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2a(x-x_{0})$. The advantage of this method is that it can be used for motion with non-uniform acceleration also. Now, we shall use these equations to some important cases.",

    "answer": "Example 2.3\nA ball is thrown vertically upwards with a velocity of 20 m $s^{-1}$ from the top of a multistorey building. The height of the point from where the ball is thrown is 25.0 m from the ground. (a) How high will the ball rise? and (b) how long will it be before the ball hits the ground? Take g = 10 $ms^{-2}$.\n\n**Answer**\n(a) Let us take the y-axis in the vertically upward direction with zero at the ground, as shown in Fig. 2.6. Now $v_{o}=+20ms^{-1}$, $a=-g=-10~m~s^{-2}$, $v=0~m~s^{-1}$. If the ball rises to height y from the point of launch, then using the equation $v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2a(y-y_{0})$ we get $0=(20)^{2}+2(-10)(y-y_{0})$. Solving, we get. $(y-y_{0})=20$ m.\n(b) We can solve this part of the problem in two ways. Note carefully the methods used. FIRST METHOD: In the first method, we split the path in two parts: the upward motion (A to B) and the downward motion (B to C) and calculate the corresponding time taken $t_{i}$ and $t_{2}.$ Since the velocity at B is zero, we have: $v=v_{0}+at$ Or, $0=20-10t_{1}$ $t_{1}=2$ s. This is the time in going from A to B. From B, or the point of the maximum height, the ball falls freely under the acceleration due to gravity. The ball is moving in negative y direction. We use equation $y=y_{0}+v_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$. We have, $y_{0}=45m.$ $y=0,$ $v_{0}=0$ $a=-g=-10ms^{-2}$. $0=45+(\\frac{1}{2})(-10)t^{2}$. Solving, we get $t_{2}=3$ s. Therefore, the total time taken by the ball before it hits the ground $=t_{1}+t_{2}=2~s+3~s=5~s$. SECOND METHOD: The total time taken can also be calculated by noting the coordinates of initial and final positions of the ball with respect to the origin chosen and using equation $y=y_{0}+v_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$. Now $y_{0}=25~m$ $y=0~m$. $v_{o}=20ms^{-1}$, $a=-10m~s^{-2}$, $t=?$. $0=25+20t+(\\frac{1}{2})$ (-10) t². Or. $5t^{2}-20t-25=0$. Solving this quadratic equation for t, we get $t=5s$. Note that the second method is better since we do not have to worry about the path of the motion as the motion is under constant acceleration.",

The magnitude of acceleration due to gravity is represented by g. If air resistance is neglected, the object is said to be in free fall. If the height through which the object falls is small compared to the earth's radius, g can be taken to be constant, equal to $9.8~m~s^{-2}$ Free fall is thus a case of motion with uniform acceleration. We assume that the motion is in y-direction, more correctly in-y-direction because we choose upward direction as positive. Since the acceleration due to gravity is always downward, it is in the negative direction and we have $a=-g=-9.8~m~s^{-2}$. The object is released from rest at $y=0$ Therefore, $v_{0}=0$ and the equations of motion become: $v=0-gt=-9.8~t$ ms¹. $y=0-\\frac{1}{2}g~t^{2}=-4.9~t^{2}$ $v^{2}=0-2~g~y=-19.6~y$ $m^{2}s^{-2}$. These equations give the velocity and the distance travelled as a function of time and also the variation of velocity with distance. The variation of acceleration, velocity, and distance, with time have been plotted in Fig. 2.7(a), (b) and (c).",

It is an important factor for road safety and depends on the initial velocity ( $(v_{0})$ and the braking capacity, or deceleration. -a that is caused by the braking. Derive an expression for stopping distance of a vehicle in terms of $\\mathcal{D}_{n}$ anda.\n\n**Answer**\nLet the distance travelled by the vehicle before it stops be $d_{s}$ Then, using equation of motion $\\nu^{2}=\\nu_{0}^{2}+2$ ax, and noting that $v=0,$ we have the stopping distance $d_{s}=\\frac{-v_{0}^{2}}{2a}$. Thus, the stopping distance is proportional to the square of the initial velocity. Doubling the initial velocity increases the stopping distance by a factor of 4 (for the same deceleration). For the car of a particular make, the braking distance was found to be 10 m, 20 m, 34 m and 50 m corresponding to velocities of 11, 15, 20 and $25~m/s$ which are nearly consistent with the above formula.

Reaction time is the time a person takes to observe, think and act. For example, if a person is driving and suddenly a boy appears on the road, then the time elapsed before he slams the brakes of the car is the reaction time. Reaction time depends on complexity of the situation and on an individual. You can measure your reaction time by a simple experiment. Take a ruler and ask your friend to drop it vertically through the gap between your thumb and forefinger (Fig. 2.8). After you catch it, find the distance d travelled by the ruler. In a particular case, d was found to be 21.0 cm. Estimate reaction time.\n\n**Answer**\nThe ruler drops under free fall. Therefore, $v_{O}=0$ and $a=-g=-9.8$ m s². The distance travelled dand the reaction time tare related by $d=-\\frac{1}{2}gt_{r}^{2}$. Or, $t_{r}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2d}{g}}s$.

For motion in a straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as negative.\n2. The average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval.\n3. Instantaneous velocity or simply velocity is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval $\\Delta t$ becomes infinitesimally small : $v=lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\overline{v}=lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{dx}{d~t}$. The velocity at a particular instant is equal to the slope of the tangent drawn on position-time graph at that instant.\n4.

The area under the velocity-time curve between times t₁ and $t_{2}$ is equal to the displacement of the object during that interval of time.\n8. For objects in uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion, the five quantities, displacement x, time taken t, initial velocity $v_{0}$, final velocity v and acceleration a are related by a set of simple equations called kinematic equations of motion: $v=v_{0}+at$ $x=v_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$ $v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2ax$. if the position of the object at time $t=0$ is O.

We found that the directional aspect of these quantities can be taken care of by + and − signs, as in one dimension only two directions are possible. But in order to describe motion of an object in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions (space), we need to use vectors to describe the above-mentioned physical quantities. Therefore, it is first necessary to learn the language of vectors. What is a vector? How to add, subtract and multiply vectors? What is the result of multiplying a vector by a real number? We shall learn this to enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and acceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object in a plane. As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail the projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of motion that has a special significance in daily-life situations. We shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail.\n\nThe equations developed in this chapter for motion in a plane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Scalars and Vectors",
    "answer": "In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or vectors. Basically, the difference is that a \\textbf{direction} is associated with a vector but not with a scalar. A scalar quantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified completely by a single number, along with the proper unit. Examples are: the distance between two points, mass of an object, the temperature of a body and the time at which a certain event happened. The rules for combining scalars are the rules of ordinary algebra. Scalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided. For example, if the length and breadth of a rectangle are 1.0 m and 0.5 m respectively, then its perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the four sides, \\(1.0\\, \\text{m} + 0.5\\, \\text{m} + 1.0\\, \\text{m} + 0.5\\, \\text{m} = 3.0\\, \\text{m}\\). The length of each side is a scalar and the perimeter is also a scalar.\n\nTake another example: the maximum and minimum temperatures on a particular day are 35.6 °C and 24.2 °C respectively. Then, the difference between the two temperatures is 11.4 °C.\n\nSimilarly, if a uniform solid cube of aluminum of side 10 cm has a mass of 2.7 kg, then its volume is \\(10^{-3}\\, \\text{m}^3\\) (a scalar) and its density is \\(2.7 \\times 10^3\\, \\text{kg m}^{-3}\\) (a scalar).\n\nA vector quantity is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction and obeys the \\textbf{triangle law of addition} or equivalently the \\textbf{parallelogram law of addition}. So, a vector is specified by giving its magnitude by a number and its direction. Some physical quantities that are represented by vectors are displacement, velocity, acceleration and force.\n\nTo represent a vector, we use a bold face type in this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be represented by a symbol \\( \\vec{v} \\). Since bold face is difficult to produce, when written by hand, a vector is often represented by an arrow placed over a letter, say \\( \\vec{v} \\). Thus, both \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) and \\( \\vec{v} \\) represent the velocity vector. The magnitude of a vector is often called its absolute value, indicated by \\( |\\vec{v}| \\). A vector is represented by a bold face, e.g., by \\( \\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{r}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\), with respective magnitudes denoted by light face \\( A, a, p, q, r, \\ldots, x, y \\).",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Position and Displacement Vectors",
    "answer": "To describe the position of an object moving in a plane, we need to choose a convenient point, say O as origin. Let P and P′ be the positions of the object at time \\( t \\) and \\( t′ \\), respectively. We join O and P by a straight line. Then, OP is the position vector of the object at time \\( t \\). An arrow is marked at the head of this line. It is represented by a symbol, i.e., \\( OP = \\vec{r} \\). Point P′ is represented by another position vector, OP′ denoted by \\( \\vec{r}' \\).\n\nThe length of the vector \\( \\vec{r} \\) represents the magnitude of the vector and its direction is the direction in which P lies as seen from O. If the object moves from P to P′, the vector PP′ (with tail at P and tip at P′) is called the \\textbf{displacement vector} corresponding to motion from point P (at time \\( t \\)) to point P′ (at time \\( t′ \\)).\n\nIt is important to note that displacement vector is the straight line joining the initial and final positions and does not depend on the actual path undertaken by the object between the two positions. For example, in Fig. 3.1(b), given the initial and final positions as P and Q, the displacement vector is the same PQ for different paths of journey, say PABCQ, PDQ, and PBEFQ.\n\nTherefore, the \\textbf{magnitude of displacement is either less or equal to the path length of an object between two points}.

    "answer": "As mentioned in Section 4.2, vectors, by definition, obey the triangle law or equivalently, the parallelogram law of addition. We shall now describe this law of addition using the graphical method.\n\nLet us consider two vectors \\( \\vec{A} \\) and \\( \\vec{B} \\) that lie in a plane as shown. The lengths of the line segments representing these vectors are proportional to the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nTo find the sum \\( \\vec{A} + \\vec{B} \\), we place vector \\( \\vec{B} \\) so that its tail is at the head of vector \\( \\vec{A} \\). Then, we join the tail of \\( \\vec{A} \\) to the head of \\( \\vec{B} \\). This line represents a vector \\( \\vec{R} \\), that is, the sum of the vectors \\( \\vec{A} \\) and \\( \\vec{B} \\).\n\nSince, in this procedure of vector addition, vectors are placed head-to-tail, the resultant vector \\( \\vec{R} = \\vec{A} + \\vec{B} \\) is given by the third side of the triangle formed, taken in the reverse order.\n\nThis graphical approach also extends to more than two vectors. For instance, if three vectors \\( \\vec{A}, \\vec{B}, \\vec{C} \\) are to be added, we follow the same rule sequentially: place \\( \\vec{B} \\) at the head of \\( \\vec{A} \\), then \\( \\vec{C} \\) at the head of \\( \\vec{B} \\). The resultant vector \\( \\vec{R} = \\vec{A} + \\vec{B} + \\vec{C} \\) is the vector joining the tail of \\( \\vec{A} \\) to the head of \\( \\vec{C} \\).\n\nIf we find the result of \\( \\vec{B} + \\vec{A} \\) as in Fig. 3.4(c), the same vector \\( \\vec{R} \\) is obtained. Thus, vector addition is \\textbf{commutative}:\n\\[\n\\vec{A} + \\vec{B} = \\vec{B} + \\vec{A} \\tag{3.1}\n\\]\n\nThe addition of vectors also obeys the associative law as illustrated in Fig. 3.4(d). The result of adding vectors \\( \\vec{A} \\) and \\( \\vec{B} \\) first and then adding vector \\( \\vec{C} \\) is the same as the result of adding \\( \\vec{B} \\) and \\( \\vec{C} \\) first and then adding vector \\( \\vec{A} \\):\n\\[\n(\\vec{A} + \\vec{B}) + \\vec{C} = \\vec{A} + (\\vec{B} + \\vec{C}) \\tag{3.2}\n\\]\n\nWhat is the result of adding two equal and opposite vectors? Consider two vectors \\( \\vec{A} \\) and \\( -\\vec{A} \\) shown in Fig. 3.3(b). Their sum is \\( \\vec{A} + (-\\vec{A}) \\). Since the magnitudes of the two vectors are the same, but the directions are opposite, the resultant vector has zero magnitude and is represented by 0 — called a \\textbf{null vector} or a \\textbf{zero vector}:\n\\[\n\\vec{A} - \\vec{A} = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad |0| = 0 \\tag{3.3}\n\\]\n\nSince the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its direction cannot be specified.\n\nThe null vector also results when we multiply a vector \\( \\vec{A} \\) by the number zero. The main properties of \\( 0 \\) are:\n\\[\n\\vec{A} + 0 = \\vec{A} \\\\\n\\lambda 0 = 0 \\\\\n0\\vec{A} = 0 \\tag{3.4}\n\\]",

Since the initial and final positions coincide, the displacement is a \\textbf{null vector}.\n\n\\textbf{Subtraction of vectors} can be defined in terms of addition of vectors.

Now we join the point of the intersection of these two lines to the origin O.

  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of Unit Vectors and Vector Resolution",
    "answer": "Using this method, one can resolve a given vector into two component vectors along a set of two vectors — all the three lie in the same plane. It is convenient to resolve a general vector along the axes of a rectangular coordinate system using vectors of unit magnitude. These are called unit vectors. A unit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and points in a particular direction. It has no dimension and no unit. It is used to specify a direction only. Unit vectors along the x-, y- and z-axes of a rectangular coordinate system are denoted by \\( \\hat{i} \\), \\( \\hat{j} \\), and \\( \\hat{k} \\), respectively, as shown in the figure.\n\nSince these are unit vectors, we have:\n\\[\n|\\hat{i}| = |\\hat{j}| = |\\hat{k}| = 1 \\tag{3.9}\n\\]\n\nThese unit vectors are perpendicular to each other. In text, they are printed in bold face with a cap (\\( \\hat{~} \\)) to distinguish them from other vectors. Since we are dealing with motion in two dimensions in this chapter, we require use of only two unit vectors. If we multiply a unit vector \\( \\hat{n} \\) by a scalar \\( \\lambda \\), the result is a vector:\n\\[\n\\vec{A} = |A| \\hat{n} \\tag{3.10}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hat{n} \\) is a unit vector along \\( \\vec{A} \\).\n\nWe can now resolve a vector \\( \\vec{A} \\) in terms of component vectors that lie along unit vectors \\( \\hat{i} \\) and \\( \\hat{j} \\). Consider a vector \\( \\vec{A} \\) that lies in the x–y plane. We draw lines from the head of \\( \\vec{A} \\) perpendicular to the coordinate axes and get vectors \\( \\vec{A}_1 \\) and \\( \\vec{A}_2 \\) such that:\n\\[\n\\vec{A} = \\vec{A}_1 + \\vec{A}_2\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\vec{A}_1 \\) is parallel to \\( \\hat{i} \\) and \\( \\vec{A}_2 \\) is parallel to \\( \\hat{j} \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\vec{A}_1 = A_x \\hat{i}, \\quad \\vec{A}_2 = A_y \\hat{j} \\tag{3.11}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A_x \\) and \\( A_y \\) are real numbers.\n\nThus,\n\\[\n\\vec{A} = A_x \\hat{i} + A_y \\hat{j} \\tag{3.12}\n\\]\n\nThis is represented in the figure. The quantities \\( A_x \\) and \\( A_y \\) are called x- and y-components of the vector \\( \\vec{A} \\). Note that \\( \\vec{A} \\) is itself not a vector, but \\( A_x \\hat{i} \\) and \\( A_y \\hat{j} \\) are vectors.\n\nUsing simple trigonometry, we can express \\( A_x \\) and \\( A_y \\) in terms of the magnitude \\( A \\) and the angle \\( \\theta \\) it makes with the x-axis:\n\\[\nA_x = A \\cos \\theta, \\quad A_y = A \\sin \\theta \\tag{3.13}\n\\]\n\nAs is clear from Eq. (3.13), a component of a vector can be positive, negative or zero depending on the value of \\( \\theta \\).\n\nNow, we have two ways to specify a vector \\( \\vec{A} \\) in a plane. It can be specified by:\n(i) its magnitude \\( A \\) and the direction \\( \\theta \\) it makes with the x-axis; or\n(ii) its components \\( A_x \\) and \\( A_y \\).\n\nIf \\( A \\) and \\( \\theta \\) are given, \\( A_x \\) and \\( A_y \\) can be obtained using Eq. (3.13). If \\( A_x \\) and \\( A_y \\) are given, \\( A \\) and \\( \\theta \\) can be obtained as follows:\n\\[\nA_x^2 + A_y^2 = A^2 \\cos^2 \\theta + A^2 \\sin^2 \\theta = A^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow A = \\sqrt{A_x^2 + A_y^2} \\tag{3.14}\n\\]\n\nAnd,\n\\[\n\\tan \\theta = \\frac{A_y}{A_x}, \\quad \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{A_y}{A_x}\\right) \\tag{3.15}\n\\]",

Using the parallelogram method of addition, the resultant \\( \\vec{R} \\) is obtained in the direction shown in the figure.\n\nWe can obtain the magnitude of \\( R \\) using the law of cosine:\n\\[\nR = \\sqrt{v_b^2 + v_c^2 + 2 v_b v_c \\cos 120^\\circ}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{25^2 + 10^2 + 2 \\cdot 25 \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)} = \\sqrt{625 + 100 - 250} = \\sqrt{475} \\approx 21.8 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nTo obtain the direction, we apply the law of sines:\n\\[\n\\frac{v_c}{\\sin \\theta} = \\frac{R}{\\sin \\phi} \\Rightarrow \\sin \\phi = \\frac{R \\sin \\theta}{v_c} \\\\\n\\sin \\phi = \\frac{21.8 \\cdot \\sin 120^\\circ}{10} = \\frac{21.8 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{10} = 0.397\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi = \\sin^{-1}(0.397) \\approx 23.4^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo the resultant velocity makes an angle of approximately \\( 23.4^\\circ \\) from the north towards west.",

    "answer": "An object in flight after being projected is called a projectile. Its motion is the result of two simultaneous components:\n1. Horizontal motion (no acceleration)\n2. Vertical motion (constant acceleration due to gravity)\n\nGalileo observed this independence in 1632.\n\nAssume air resistance is negligible. Suppose projectile is launched with initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta_0 \\) with the x-axis.\n\nAcceleration due to gravity is vertically downwards:\n\\[ \n\\vec{a} = -g \\hat{j} \\Rightarrow a_x = 0, \\quad a_y = -g \n\\]\n\nInitial velocity components:\n\\[ \n v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos \\theta_0, \\quad v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin \\theta_0 \n\\]\n\nIf we take the initial position to be the origin of the reference frame, then:\\(X_0 = 0, \\quad Y_0 = 0\\)\nFrom the kinematic equations, the position at time \\( t \\) is:\n\\[\nx = v_{0x} t = (v_0 \\cos \\theta_0) t\n\\]\n\\[\ny = v_{0y} t + \\frac{1}{2} a_y t^2 = (v_0 \\sin \\theta_0) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\n\\]\n\nThe components of velocity at time \\( t \\) are:\n\\[\nv_x = v_{0x} + a_x t = v_0 \\cos \\theta_0\n\\]\n\\[\nv_y = v_{0y} + a_y t = v_0 \\sin \\theta_0 - g t\n\\]\n\nNote: The x-component of velocity remains constant during the motion, while the y-component changes due to gravity. At maximum height, \\( v_y = 0 \\), so the velocity vector is purely horizontal. The direction of velocity \\( \\theta_v \\) at any point is given by:\\( \\theta_v = \\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{v_y}{v_x} \\right) \\). At max height, \\( \\theta_v = 0 \\).",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Uniform Circular Motion",
    "answer": "When an object moves along a circular path at a constant speed \\( v \\), it is said to be in uniform circular motion. Although the speed remains constant, the direction of velocity changes continuously, which implies that the object undergoes acceleration.\n\nLet \\( \\vec{r} \\) and \\( \\vec{r}' \\) be the position vectors and \\( \\vec{v} \\) and \\( \\vec{v}' \\) the velocities of the object at points P and P', respectively. By definition, velocity at any point is tangential to the path in the direction of motion. The velocity vectors \\( \\vec{v} \\) and \\( \\vec{v}' \\) are shown as tangents in the figure.\n\nUsing the triangle law of vector addition, the change in velocity \\( \\Delta \\vec{v} \\) is shown to be perpendicular to \\( \\Delta \\vec{r} \\). Since the average acceleration is defined as:\\( \\vec{a}_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta \\vec{v}}{\\Delta t} \\), it follows that the average acceleration is directed towards the center of the circle.\n\nAs \\( \\Delta t \\to 0 \\), the average acceleration approaches the instantaneous acceleration, which is also directed toward the center of the circle.\n\nNow, let us find the magnitude of this acceleration:\\( |\\vec{a}| = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{|\\Delta \\vec{v}|}{\\Delta t} \\).\nLet the angle between the position vectors \\( \\vec{r} \\) and \\( \\vec{r}' \\) be \\( \\Delta \\theta \\). Since the velocity vectors are perpendicular to the position vectors, the angle between \\( \\vec{v} \\) and \\( \\vec{v}' \\) is also \\( \\Delta \\theta \\). Therefore, triangles formed by position vectors (similar to \\( CPP' \\)) and by velocity vectors (similar to \\( GHI \\)) are similar.\n\nFrom the similarity of triangles:\n\\[\n\\frac{|\\Delta \\vec{v}|}{v} = \\frac{|\\Delta \\vec{r}|}{R}\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n|\\Delta \\vec{v}| = \\frac{v \\cdot |\\Delta \\vec{r}|}{R}\n\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[\n|\\vec{a}| = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{|\\Delta \\vec{v}|}{\\Delta t} = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{v \\cdot |\\Delta \\vec{r}|}{R \\cdot \\Delta t} = \\frac{v}{R} \\cdot \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{|\\Delta \\vec{r}|}{\\Delta t}\n\\]\nWhen \\( \\Delta t \\) is small, the arc length can be approximated as \\( |\\Delta \\vec{r}| \\approx v \\cdot \\Delta t \\), so the speed is \\( \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{|\\Delta \\vec{r}|}{\\Delta t} = v \\).\n\nThus, the centripetal acceleration is:\n\\[\na_c = \\frac{v^2}{R}\n\\]\nThe acceleration is directed towards the center of the circle (centripetal acceleration). Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) was the first to publish a thorough analysis of this acceleration in 1673. The word \"centripetal\" comes from the Greek term for 'centre-seeking'.\n\nSince \\( v \\) and \\( R \\) are constant, the **magnitude** of the centripetal acceleration is also constant. However, the **direction** changes continuously, so the acceleration is **not a constant vector**.",

    "answer": "1. Scalar quantities are quantities with magnitudes only. Examples are distance, speed, mass and temperature.\n\n2. Vector quantities are quantities with magnitude and direction both. Examples are displacement, velocity and acceleration. They obey special rules of vector algebra.\n\n3. A vector \\( \\vec{A} \\) multiplied by a real number \\( \\lambda \\) is also a vector, whose magnitude is \\( |\\lambda| \\) times the magnitude of the vector \\( \\vec{A} \\) and whose direction is the same as \\( \\vec{A} \\) if \\( \\lambda \\) is positive, or opposite to \\( \\vec{A} \\) if \\( \\lambda \\) is negative.\n\n4. Two vectors \\( \\vec{A} \\) and \\( \\vec{B} \\) may be added graphically using head-to-tail method or parallelogram method.\n\n5. Vector addition is commutative:\n\\[ \\vec{A} + \\vec{B} = \\vec{B} + \\vec{A} \\]\nIt also obeys the associative law:\n\\[ (\\vec{A} + \\vec{B}) + \\vec{C} = \\vec{A} + (\\vec{B} + \\vec{C}) \\]\n\n6. A null or zero vector is a vector with zero magnitude. Since the magnitude is zero, its direction is undefined. It has the properties:\n\\[ \\vec{A} + \\vec{0} = \\vec{A}, \\quad \\lambda \\vec{0} = \\vec{0}, \\quad 0\\vec{A} = \\vec{0} \\]\n\n7. The subtraction of vector \\( \\vec{B} \\) from \\( \\vec{A} \\) is defined as the sum of \\( \\vec{A} \\) and \\( -\\vec{B} \\):\n\\[ \\vec{A} - \\vec{B} = \\vec{A} + (-\\vec{B}) \\]\n\n8. A vector \\( \\vec{A} \\) can be resolved into components along two given non-parallel vectors \\( \\vec{a} \\) and \\( \\vec{b} \\) lying in the same plane:\n\\[ \\vec{A} = \\lambda \\vec{a} + \\mu \\vec{b} \\]\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\) are real numbers.\n\n9. A unit vector associated with a vector \\( \\vec{A} \\) has magnitude 1 and points in the same direction as \\( \\vec{A} \\):\n\\[ \\hat{n} = \\frac{\\vec{A}}{|\\vec{A}|} \\]\nThe unit vectors \\( \\hat{i}, \\hat{j}, \\hat{k} \\) are vectors of unit magnitude and point in the direction of the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively in a right-handed coordinate system.\n\n10. A vector \\( \\vec{A} \\) in a two-dimensional plane can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\vec{A} = A_x \\hat{i} + A_y \\hat{j} \\]\nwhere \\( A_x, A_y \\) are its components along x- and y-axes.

The position vector of an object in the x-y plane is given by \\( \\vec{r} = x \\hat{i} + y \\hat{j} \\). The displacement from position \\( \\vec{r} \\) to position \\( \\vec{r'} \\) is:\n\\[ \\Delta \\vec{r} = \\vec{r'} - \\vec{r} = (x' - x) \\hat{i} + (y' - y) \\hat{j} = \\Delta x \\hat{i} + \\Delta y \\hat{j} \\]\n\n13. If an object undergoes a displacement \\( \\Delta \\vec{r} \\) in time \\( \\Delta t \\), its average velocity is:\\( \\vec{v}_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta \\vec{r}}{\\Delta t} \\).\nThe instantaneous velocity of an object at time \\( t \\) is the limiting value of the average velocity as \\( \\Delta t \\to 0 \\):\n\\[ \\vec{v} = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{\\Delta \\vec{r}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} \\]\nIt can be written in unit vector notation as: \\( \\vec{v} = v_x \\hat{i} + v_y \\hat{j} + v_z \\hat{k} \\), where \\( v_x = \\frac{dx}{dt}, v_y = \\frac{dy}{dt}, v_z = \\frac{dz}{dt} \\). When the position of an object is defined in a coordinate system, \\( \\vec{v} \\) is always tangent to the curve representing the path of the object. 14. If the velocity of an object changes from \\( \\vec{v} \\) to \\( \\vec{v'} \\) in time \\( \\Delta t \\), then its average acceleration is given by:\\( \\bar{\\vec{a}} = \\frac{\\vec{v'} - \\vec{v}}{\\Delta t} \\).\nThe instantaneous acceleration \\( \\vec{a} \\) at any time \\( t \\) is the limiting value of \\( \\bar{\\vec{a}} \\) as \\( \\Delta t \\to 0 \\):\n\\[ \\vec{a} = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{\\Delta \\vec{v}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} \\]\nIn component form: \\( \\vec{a} = a_x \\hat{i} + a_y \\hat{j} + a_z \\hat{k} \\), where \\( a_x = \\frac{dv_x}{dt}, a_y = \\frac{dv_y}{dt}, a_z = \\frac{dv_z}{dt} \\).\nIn 2D or 3D motion, velocity and acceleration vectors are not necessarily along the same straight line; any angle between \\( 0^\\circ \\) and \\( 180^\\circ \\) is possible between them.\n\n15. If an object is moving in a plane with constant acceleration \\( \\vec{a} = a_x \\hat{i} + a_y \\hat{j} \\) (where \\( |\\vec{a}| = \\sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2} \\)), and its position vector at \\( t = 0 \\) is \\( \\vec{r}_0 \\) with initial velocity \\( \\vec{v}_0 \\), then at any other time \\( t \\):\n\\[ \\vec{r} = \\vec{r}_0 + \\vec{v}_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{a} t^2 \\]\nVelocity is given by:\n\\[ \\vec{v} = \\vec{v}_0 + \\vec{a} t \\]\nIn component form:\n\\[ x = x_0 + v_{0x} t + \\frac{1}{2} a_x t^2 \\]\n\\[ y = y_0 + v_{0y} t + \\frac{1}{2} a_y t^2 \\]\n\\[ v_x = v_{0x} + a_x t, \\quad v_y = v_{0y} + a_y t \\]\nMotion in a plane with constant acceleration can be treated as the superposition of two independent one-dimensional motions along perpendicular directions.\n\n16. A projectile is an object in flight after being projected. If an object is projected with initial velocity \\( v_0 \\), making an angle \\( \\theta \\) with the x-axis, and if its initial position is the origin, then at time \\( t \\):\n\\[ x = (v_0 \\cos \\theta) t \\]\n\\[ y = (v_0 \\sin \\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\\[ v_x = v_0 \\cos \\theta, \\quad v_y = v_0 \\sin \\theta - g t \\]\nThe path of a projectile is parabolic:\n\\[ y = (\\tan \\theta) x - \\frac{g x^2}{2 v_0^2 \\cos^2 \\theta} \\]\n\n17. Key characteristics of projectile motion:\nMaximum height attained by a projectile:\n\\[ h_m = \\frac{(v_0 \\sin \\theta)^2}{2g} \\]\nTime to reach the maximum height:\n\\[ t_m = \\frac{v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\]\nTotal time of flight (when landing at the same initial height):\n\\[ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\]\nHorizontal range (when landing at the same initial height):\n\\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\]\nMaximum range is achieved at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\), and is given by:\n\\[ R_m = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\]\nFor launch angles \\( 45^\\circ + \\alpha \\) and \\( 45^\\circ - \\alpha \\), the horizontal ranges are equal.\n\n18. Uniform circular motion is the motion of an object with constant speed \\( v \\) in a circular path of radius \\( R \\). The centripetal acceleration is directed towards the centre and has magnitude:\n\\[ a_c = \\frac{v^2}{R} \\]\n\n19.

  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of LAWS OF MOTION",
    "answer": "In the preceding Chapter, our concern was to describe the motion of a particle in space quantitatively. We saw that uniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas non-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in addition. So far, we have not asked the question as to what governs the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this basic question. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it. To throw a stone upwards, one has to give it an upward push. A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a strong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a flowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external agency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest. Likewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop motion. You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by applying a force against the direction of its motion. In these examples, the external agency of force (hands, wind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not always necessary. A stone released from the top of a building accelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the earth. A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance. This shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and magnetic forces) can exert force on a body even from a distance. In short, a force is required to put a stationary body in motion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is needed to provide this force. The external agency may or may not be in contact with the body. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g. a skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal ice slab)? Is an external force required to keep a body in uniform motion?",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Aristotle's Fallacy",
    "answer": "The question posed above appears to be simple. However, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the correct answer to this question given by Galileo in the seventeenth century was the foundation of Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the birth of modern science. The Greek thinker, Aristotle (384 B.C-322 B.C.), held the view that if a body is moving, something external is required to keep it moving. The Aristotelian law of motion may be phrased thus: An external force is required to keep a body in motion. This law is flawed because a moving toy car, for example, comes to rest because the external force of friction on the car by the floor opposes its motion. To counter this force, a child has to apply an external force on the car in the direction of motion. When the car is in uniform motion, there is no net external force acting on it: the force by the child cancels the force (friction) by the floor. If there were no friction, the child would not be required to apply any force to keep the toy car in uniform motion. Galileo imagined a world without frictional forces to arrive at the true law of nature for forces and motion.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of The Law of Inertia",
    "answer": "Galileo studied motion of objects on an inclined plane. He concluded that an object moving on a frictionless horizontal plane must neither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it should move with constant velocity. Another experiment by Galileo involved a double inclined plane, where a ball released from rest on one plane would climb up the other. In the ideal situation, when friction is absent, the final height of the ball is the same as its initial height. In the limiting case, when the slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a horizontal), the ball would travel an infinite distance, and its motion would never cease. Galileo arrived at the insight that the state of rest and the state of uniform linear motion (motion with constant velocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is no net force acting on the body. To maintain a body in uniform motion, an external force is needed to counter the frictional force, so that the two forces sum up to zero net external force. This property of the body is called inertia, which means 'resistance to change'. A body does not change its state of rest or uniform motion unless an external force compels it to change that state. The state of rest or uniform linear motion both imply zero acceleration. The first law of motion can be simply expressed as: If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Ideas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science",
    "answer": "Ancient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force was thought to be of different kinds: force due to continuous pressure (nodan), impact (abhighat), persistent tendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line (vega), or restoration of shape in an elastic body. The notion of (vega) perhaps comes closest to the concept of inertia. Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to be opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air resistance. It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational and vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent particles. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of motion and units of length and time. Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept of 'instantaneous motion' (tatkaliki gati), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous velocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly understood.",

If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero. For example, a spaceship in interstellar space with its rockets turned off has no net external force acting on it, so its acceleration must be zero. If it is in motion, it continues to move with a uniform velocity. On Earth, an object at rest or in uniform linear motion is not because there are no forces acting on it, but because the various external forces cancel out to give a zero net external force.

    "answer": "The first law refers to the simple case when the net external force on a body is zero. The second law of motion refers to the general situation when there is a net external force acting on the body. It relates the net external force to the acceleration of the body. Momentum (p) of a body is defined as the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v): $p=mv$ (4.1). The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. The second law can be expressed as $F=k\\frac{dp}{dt}$ where k is a constant of proportionality. For a body of fixed mass, this can be written as $F=kma$. In SI units, k is chosen to be 1, so the law becomes $F=\\frac{dp}{dt}=ma$. The SI unit of force is the newton (N), defined as $1~N=1~kg~m~s^{-2}$. The second law is a vector law and is consistent with the first law (F=0 implies a=0). The acceleration at an instant is determined by the force at that instant, not by the history of the motion. The second law applies to a single point particle, a rigid body, or a system of particles, where F is the total external force and a is the acceleration of the system's center of mass. Impulse is defined as the product of force and time duration, which equals the change in momentum. For a seasoned cricketer catching a ball, drawing hands backward increases the time for the momentum change, thus requiring a smaller force.",

It is a useful concept when a large force acts for a very short duration, producing a finite change in momentum. For example, when a ball hits a wall, the force and time duration are hard to measure separately, but the impulse (change in momentum) is a measurable quantity.

What is (i) the direction of the force on the wall due to each ball? (ii) the ratio of the magnitudes of impulses imparted to the balls by the wall?\n\n**Answer**\nAn instinctive but wrong answer is that the force on the wall in case (b) is inclined at 30 degrees to the normal. The force on the wall is normal to the wall in both cases. Let u be the speed and m be the mass of each ball. We choose x and y axes as shown in the figure.\nCase (a): The initial x-component of momentum is $p_{x,initial}=mu$, and the final x-component is $p_{x,final}=-mu$. The y-component of momentum is zero both before and after the collision. The x-component of impulse is the change in momentum, which is $-2mu$. The force on the ball is in the negative x-direction, normal to the wall. By Newton's third law, the force on the wall is in the positive x-direction, normal to the wall.\nCase (b): The initial x-component of momentum is $(p_{x})_{initial}=mu\\cos30^{\\circ}$ and the final is $(p_{x})_{final}=-mu\\cos30^{\\circ}$. The y-component of momentum does not change. The x-component of impulse is $-2mu\\cos30^{\\circ}$. The direction of force is again normal to the wall along the negative x-direction. By Newton's third law, the force on the wall is normal to the wall along the positive x-direction. The ratio of the magnitudes of the impulses in (a) and (b) is $\\frac{2mu}{2mu\\cos30^{\\circ}}=\\frac{1}{\\cos30^{\\circ}}=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\approx1.2$.",

This is the law of conservation of momentum: The total momentum of an isolated system of interacting particles is conserved. For a collision between two bodies A and B, with initial momenta $p_{A}$ and $p_{B}$, and final momenta $p'_{A}$ and $p'_{B}$ respectively, the total final momentum equals the initial momentum: $p'_{A}+p'_{B}=p_{A}+p_{B}$.

    "answer": "In mechanics, we encounter several types of forces. The gravitational force is pervasive and can act at a distance. Other common forces are contact forces, which arise from contact with other objects. The component of a contact force normal to the surfaces is called normal reaction, and the component parallel to the surfaces is called friction. Other examples of contact forces include buoyant force, viscous force, and air resistance. Tension in a string and the force due to a spring are also common forces. For a spring, the restoring force F is proportional to the displacement x ($F=-kx$), where k is the force constant. At the microscopic level, these contact forces arise from electrical forces between the charged constituents of bodies.",

What is the coefficient of static friction between the block and the surface?\n\n**Answer**\nThe forces acting on the block are weight (mg), normal force (N), and static frictional force ($f_{s}$). In equilibrium, the resultant of these forces is zero. Resolving the weight along the two directions gives $mg\\sin\\theta=f_{s}$ and $mg\\cos\\theta=N$.

What is the tension in the string? (Take $g=10~m/s^{2}$). Neglect the mass of the string.\n\n**Answer**\nSince the string is inextensible and the pulley is smooth, the 3 kg block and the 20 kg trolley have the same magnitude of acceleration. Applying the second law to the block: $30-T=3a$. Applying the second law to the trolley: $T-f_{k}=20a$. The kinetic friction is $f_{k}=\\mu_{k}N=\\mu_{k}mg=0.04\\times(20\\times10)=8~N$. The equation for the trolley's motion is $T-8=20a$. Solving these two equations gives $a=\\frac{22}{23}~m~s^{-2}\\approx0.96~m~s^{-2}$ and $T=27.1~N$.",

If the coefficient of friction between the wheels of a race-car and the road is 0.2, what is the (a) optimum speed of the race-car to avoid wear and tear on its tyres, and (b) maximum permissible speed to avoid slipping?\n\n**Answer**\n(a) The optimum speed $v_{o}$ is given by $v_{o}=(R~g~tan~\\theta)^{1/2}$ (4.22). With $R=300~m, \\theta=15^{\\circ}, g=9.8~m~s^{-2}$, the optimum speed is $v_{o}=28.1~m~s^{-1}$.\n(b) The maximum permissible speed $v_{max}$ is given by $v_{max}=(Rg\\frac{\\mu_{s}+tan\\theta}{1-\\mu_{s}tan\\theta})^{1/2}$ (4.21). Substituting the values, we get $v_{max}=38.1~m~s^{-1}$.",

A useful tool for this is a 'free-body diagram', which is a separate diagram showing the chosen system and all the forces acting on it. When using free-body diagrams for different systems, Newton's third law should be employed: if a force on body A due to B is shown as F, then the force on B due to A must be shown as -F.",

    "answer": "Example 4.12\nA wooden block of mass 2 kg rests on a soft horizontal floor. An iron cylinder of mass 25 kg is placed on top of the block, and the floor yields, causing the block and cylinder to go down with an acceleration of $0.1~m~s^{-2}$. What is the action of the block on the floor (a) before and (b) after the floor yields? (Take $g=10~m~s^{-2}$). Identify the action-reaction pairs in the problem.\n\n**Answer**\n(a) Before the floor yields, the block is at rest. The force of gravity on the block is $2\\times10=20~N$ and the normal force R from the floor is also 20 N (by the First Law). By the third law, the action of the block on the floor is 20 N downwards.\n(b) After the floor yields, the total mass is $2+25=27~kg$. The system accelerates downwards with $0.1~m~s^{-2}$. The forces on the system are gravity ($27\\times10=270~N$) and the normal force $R'$ from the floor. Applying the second law to the system: $270-R'=27\\times0.1$, which gives $R'=267.3~N$. By the third law, the action of the system on the floor is 267.3 N downwards.\n**Action-reaction pairs**\n* For (a): The force of gravity (20 N) on the block by the earth and the force of gravity on the earth by the block (reaction). Also, the force on the floor by the block and the force on the block by the floor.\n* For (b): The force of gravity (270 N) on the system by the earth and the force of gravity on the earth by the system (reaction). Also, the force on the floor by the system and the force on the system by the floor. Additionally, the force on the block by the cylinder and the force on the cylinder by the block form an action-reaction pair.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of SUMMARY OF UNITS AND MEASUREMENT",
    "answer": "1. Aristotle's view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong. In practice, a force is necessary to counter opposing forces like friction.\n2. Newton's first law of motion is based on Galileo's law of inertia: \"Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise\". In simple terms, if the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero.\n3. Momentum (p) is the product of a body's mass (m) and velocity (v): $p=mv$.\n4. Newton's second law states that the rate of change of momentum is proportional to the applied force. The equation is $F=\\frac{dp}{dt}=ma$, where F is the net external force and a is acceleration. The SI unit of force is the newton ($1~N=1~kg~m~s^{-2}$).\n5. Impulse is the product of force and time, equal to the change in momentum.\n6. Newton's third law states: \"To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction\". Forces always occur in pairs, acting on different bodies.\n7. The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved, a consequence of the second and third laws.\n8. Frictional force opposes impending or actual relative motion between surfaces. Static friction ($f_{s}$) opposes impending motion ($f_{s}\\le\\mu_{s}R$), and kinetic friction ($f_{k}$) opposes actual motion ($f_{k}=\\mu_{k}R$). The coefficient of kinetic friction $\\mu_{k}$ is less than the coefficient of static friction $\\mu_{s}$.\n9. The centripetal force is not a new kind of force but is the force that provides the inward radial acceleration for circular motion.",
