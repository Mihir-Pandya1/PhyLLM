We found that the directional aspect of these quantities can be taken care of by + and signs, as in one dimension only two directions are possible. But in order to describe motion of an object in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions (space), we need to use vectors to describe the above- mentioned physical quantities. Therefore, it is first necessary to learn the language of vectors. How to add, subtract and multiply vectors? What is the result of multiplying a vector by a real number? We shall learn this to enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and acceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object in a plane. As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail the projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of motion that has a special significance in daily-life situations. We shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail. The equations developed in this chapter for motion in a plane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions.",

    "content": "In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or vectors. Basically, the difference is that a direction is associated with a vector but not with a scalar. A scalar quantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified completely by a single number, along with the proper unit. Examples are the distance between two points, mass of an object, the temperature of a body and the time at which a certain event happened. The rules for combining scalars are the rules of ordinary algebra. Scalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided just as the ordinary numbers. For example, if the length and breadth of a rectangle are 1.0 m and 0.5 m respectively, then its perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the four sides, $1.0~m+0.5~m+1.0~m+0.5~m = 3.0~m$. The length of each side is a scalar and the perimeter is also a scalar. A vector quantity is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction and obeys the triangle law of addition or equivalently the parallelogram law of addition. So, a vector is specified by giving its magnitude by a number and its direction. Some physical quantities that are represented by vectors are displacement, velocity, acceleration and force. To represent a vector, we use a bold face type in this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be represented by a symbol v. Since bold face is difficult to produce, when written by hand, a vector is often represented by an arrow placed over a letter, say $\\vec{v}$. Thus, both v and $\\vec{v}$ represent the velocity vector. The magnitude of a vector is often called its absolute value, indicated by $|v|$. A vector is represented by a bold face, e.g. by A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light face A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y.",

    "content": "To describe the position of an object moving in a plane, we need to choose a convenient point, say O as origin. Let P and P' be the positions of the object at time t and t', respectively. We join O and P by a straight line. Then, OP is the position vector of the object at time t. An arrow is marked at the head of this line. It is represented by a symbol r, i.e. $OP=r$. Point P' is represented by another position vector, OP' denoted by r'. The length of the vector r represents the magnitude of the vector and its direction is the direction in which P lies as seen from O. If the object moves from P to P', the vector PP' (with tail at P and tip at P') is called the displacement vector corresponding to motion from point P (at time t) to point P' (at time t'). It is important to note that displacement vector is the straight line joining the initial and final positions and does not depend on the actual path undertaken by the object between the two positions. For example, given the initial and final positions as P and Q, the displacement vector is the same PQ for different paths of journey. Therefore, the magnitude of displacement is either less or equal to the path length of an object between two points. This fact was emphasised in the previous chapter also while discussing motion along a straight line.",

    "content": "In the preceding Chapter, our concern was to describe the motion of a particle in space quantitatively. We saw that uniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas non-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in addition. So far, we have not asked the question as to what governs the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this basic question. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it. To throw a stone upwards, one has to give it an upward push. A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a strong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a flowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external agency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest. Likewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop motion. You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by applying a force against the direction of its motion. In these examples, the external agency of force (hands, wind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not always necessary. A stone released from the top of a building accelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the earth. A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance. This shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and magnetic forces) can exert force on a body even from a distance. In short, a force is required to put a stationary body in motion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is needed to provide this force. The external agency may or may not be in contact with the body. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g. a skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal ice slab)? Is an external force required to keep a body in uniform motion?",

    "content": "The question posed above appears to be simple. However, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the correct answer to this question given by Galileo in the seventeenth century was the foundation of Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the birth of modern science. The Greek thinker, Aristotle (384 B.C-322 B.C.), held the view that if a body is moving, something external is required to keep it moving. The Aristotelian law of motion may be phrased thus: An external force is required to keep a body in motion. This law is flawed because a moving toy car, for example, comes to rest because the external force of friction on the car by the floor opposes its motion. To counter this force, a child has to apply an external force on the car in the direction of motion. When the car is in uniform motion, there is no net external force acting on it: the force by the child cancels the force (friction) by the floor. If there were no friction, the child would not be required to apply any force to keep the toy car in uniform motion. Galileo imagined a world without frictional forces to arrive at the true law of nature for forces and motion.",

    "content": "Galileo studied motion of objects on an inclined plane. He concluded that an object moving on a frictionless horizontal plane must neither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it should move with constant velocity. Another experiment by Galileo involved a double inclined plane, where a ball released from rest on one plane would climb up the other. In the ideal situation, when friction is absent, the final height of the ball is the same as its initial height. In the limiting case, when the slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a horizontal), the ball would travel an infinite distance, and its motion would never cease. Galileo arrived at the insight that the state of rest and the state of uniform linear motion (motion with constant velocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is no net force acting on the body. To maintain a body in uniform motion, an external force is needed to counter the frictional force, so that the two forces sum up to zero net external force. This property of the body is called inertia, which means 'resistance to change'. A body does not change its state of rest or uniform motion unless an external force compels it to change that state. The state of rest or uniform linear motion both imply zero acceleration. The first law of motion can be simply expressed as: If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero.",

    "content": "Ancient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force was thought to be of different kinds: force due to continuous pressure (nodan), impact (abhighat), persistent tendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line (vega), or restoration of shape in an elastic body. The notion of (vega) perhaps comes closest to the concept of inertia. Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to be opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air resistance. It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational and vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent particles. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of motion and units of length and time. Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept of 'instantaneous motion' (tatkaliki gati), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous velocity using Differential Calculus.

Newton's first law of motion states: Every body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise. If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero. For example, a spaceship in interstellar space with its rockets turned off has no net external force acting on it, so its acceleration must be zero. If it is in motion, it continues to move with a uniform velocity. On Earth, an object at rest or in uniform linear motion is not because there are no forces acting on it, but because the various external forces cancel out to give a zero net external force. The property of inertia is evident when a bus suddenly starts or stops, causing passengers to be thrown backward or forward, respectively.",

    "content": "The first law refers to the simple case when the net external force on a body is zero. The second law of motion refers to the general situation when there is a net external force acting on the body. It relates the net external force to the acceleration of the body. Momentum (p) of a body is defined as the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v): $p=mv$ (4.1). The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. The second law can be expressed as $F=k\\frac{dp}{dt}$ where k is a constant of proportionality. For a body of fixed mass, this can be written as $F=kma$. In SI units, k is chosen to be 1, so the law becomes $F=\\frac{dp}{dt}=ma$. The SI unit of force is the newton (N), defined as $1~N=1~kg~m~s^{-2}$. The second law is a vector law and is consistent with the first law (F=0 implies a=0). The acceleration at an instant is determined by the force at that instant, not by the history of the motion. The second law applies to a single point particle, a rigid body, or a system of particles, where F is the total external force and a is the acceleration of the system's center of mass. Impulse is defined as the product of force and time duration, which equals the change in momentum. For a seasoned cricketer catching a ball, drawing hands backward increases the time for the momentum change, thus requiring a smaller force.",

Normally, the reported result of measurement is a number that includes all digits in the number that are known reliably plus the first digit that is uncertain. The reliable digits plus the first uncertain digit are known as significant digits or significant figures.

The rules for determining the number of significant figures can be understood from the following examples. Significant figures indicate, as already mentioned, the precision of measurement which depends on the least count of the measuring instrument. A choice of change of different units does not change the number of significant digits or figures in a measurement. This important remark makes most of the following observations clear: (1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four significant figures. But in different units, the same value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08 mm or $23080~\\mu m$. All these numbers have the same number of significant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four.",

    "content": "(3) To remove such ambiguities in determining the number of significant figures, the best way is to report every measurement in scientific notation (in the power of 10). In this notation, every number is expressed as $a\\times10^{b}$ where a is a number between 1 and 10, and b is any positive or negative exponent (or power) of 10. In order to get an approximate idea of the number, we may round off the number a to 1 (for $a\\le5$) and to 10 (for $5<a\\le10)$. Then the number can be expressed approximately as $10^{b}$ in which the exponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of magnitude of the physical quantity. When only an estimate is required, the quantity is of the order of $10^{b}$ For example, the diameter of the earth $(1.28\\times10^{7}m)$ is of the order of $10^{7}m$ with the order of magnitude 7. The diameter of hydrogen atom $(1.06\\times10^{-10}m)$ is of the order of $10^{-10}m$, with the order of magnitude -10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders of magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom. It is often customary to write the decimal after the first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in (a) above disappears : $4.700~m=4.700\\times10^{2}cm =4.700\\times10^{3}mm=4.700\\times10^{-3}km$. The power of 10 is irrelevant to the determination of significant figures. However, all zeroes appearing in the base number in the scientific notation are significant. Each number in this case has four significant figures. Thus, in the scientific notation, no confusion arises about the trailing zero(s) in the base number a. They are always significant.",

It cannot be more accurate than the original measured values themselves on which the result is based. In general, the final result should not have more significant figures than the original data from which it was obtained. Thus, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be $2.51~cm^{3}$ then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is $1.68804780876~g/cm^{3}$ upto 11 decimal places. It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant to record the calculated value of density to such a precision when the measurements on which the value is based, have much less precision.

The rules for rounding off numbers to the appropriate significant figures are obvious in most cases. A number 2.746 rounded off to three significant figures is 2.75, while the number 1.743 would be 1.74. The rule by convention is that the preceding digit is raised by 1 if the insignificant digit to be dropped (the underlined digit in this case) is more than 5, and is left unchanged if the latter is less than 5. But what if the number is 2.745 in which the insignificant digit is 5. Here, the convention is that if the preceding digit is even, the insignificant digit is simply dropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit is raised by 1. Then, the number 2.745 rounded off to three significant figures becomes 1.74. On the other hand, the number 2.735 rounded off to three significant figures becomes 1.74 since the preceding digit is odd. In any involved or complex multi-step calculation, you should retain, in intermediate steps, one digit more than the significant digits and round off to proper significant figures at the end of the calculation. Similarly, a number known to be within many significant figures, such as in $2.99792458\\times10^{8}m/s$ for the speed of light in vacuum, is rounded off to an approximate value $3\\times10^{8}m/s$, which is often employed in computations.

It means that the length may be written as $16.2 \\pm 0.1~cm$ $=16.2~cm\\pm0.6\\%$. Similarly, the breadth b may be written as $b=10.1\\pm0.1~cm$ $=10.1~cm\\pm1\\%$.

This leads us to quote the final result as $1b164+3~cm^{2}$. Here $3~cm^{2}$ is the uncertainty or error in the estimation of area of rectangular sheet.\n(2) If a set of experimental data is specified to n significant figures, a result obtained by combining the data will also be valid to n significant figures. However, if data are subtracted, the number of significant figures can be reduced. For example, 12.9 g - 7.06 g. both specified to three significant figures, cannot properly be evaluated as 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as uncertainties in subtraction or addition combine in a different fashion (smallest number of decimal places rather than the number of significant figures in any of the number added or subtracted).",

Similarly, the relative error in 9.89 g is $=(\\pm0.01/9.89)\\times100\\%$ $=\\pm0.1\\%$.\nFinally, remember that intermediate results in a multi-step computation should be calculated to one more significant figure in every measurement than the number of digits in the least precise measurement. These should be justified by the data and then the arithmetic operations may be carried out; otherwise rounding errors can build up. For example, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after rounding off) to the same number of significant figures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of 0.104 calculated to three significant figures is 9.62. However, if we had written $1/9.58=0.1044$ and then taken the reciprocal to three significant figures, we would have retrieved the original value of 9.58. This example justifies the idea to retain one more extra digit (than the number of digits in the least precise measurement) in intermediate steps of the complex multi-step calculations in order to avoid additional errors in the process of rounding off the numbers.",

All the physical quantities represented by derived units can be expressed in terms of some combination of seven fundamental or base quantities. We shall call these base quantities as the seven dimensions of the physical world, which are denoted with square brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the dimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current [A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous intensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol]. The dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers (or exponents) to which the base quantities are raised to represent that quantity. Note that using the square brackets [ ] around a quantity means that we are dealing with 'the dimensions of the quantity. In mechanics, all the physical quantities can be written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M] and [T]. For example, the volume occupied by an object is expressed as the product of length, breadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the dimensions of volume are $[L]\\times[L]\\times[L]=[L]^{3}=[L^{3}]$. As the volume is independent of mass and time, it is said to possess zero dimension in mass [$M^{0}$], zero dimension in time [$T^{0}$] and three dimensions in length. Similarly, force, as the product of mass and acceleration, can be expressed as Force = mass x acceleration = mass $\\times$ (length)/(time)Â².

If the dimensions of all the terms are not same, the equation is wrong. Hence, if we derive an expression for the length (or distance) of an object, regardless of the symbols appearing in the original mathematical relation, when all the individual dimensions are simplified, the remaining dimension must be that of length.

The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and the derived quantities obtained from them. Certain derived units are expressed by means of Sl units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).\n6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m for metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).\n7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific notation, with powers of 10. Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify measurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision of the numbers.",

We applied the results of our study even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming that motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the motion of a particle. Any real body which we encounter in daily life has a finite size. In dealing with the motion of extended bodies (bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is inadequate. In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this inadequacy. We shall attempt to build an understanding of the motion of extended bodies. An extended body, in the first place, is a system of particles. We shall begin with the consideration of motion of the system as a whole. The centre of mass of a system of particles will be a key concept here. We shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system of particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding the motion of extended bodies. A large class of problems with extended bodies can be solved by considering them to be rigid bodies. Ideally a rigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and unchanging shape. The distances between all pairs of particles of such a body do not change. It is evident from this definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid, since real bodies deform under the influence of forces. But in many situations the deformations are negligible. In a number of situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel beams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore that they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treat them as rigid.",

    "content": "Let us try to explore this question by taking some examples of the motion of rigid bodies. Let us begin with a rectangular block sliding down an inclined plane without any sidewise movement. The block is taken as a rigid body. Its motion down the plane is such that all the particles of the body are moving together, i.e. they have the same velocity at any instant of time. The rigid body here is in pure translational motion. In pure translational motion at any instant of time, all particles of the body have the same velocity. Consider now the rolling motion of a solid metallic or wooden cylinder down the same inclined plane. The rigid body in this problem, namely the cylinder, shifts from the top to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus, seems to have translational motion. But as Fig. 6.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with the same velocity at any instant. The body, therefore, is not in pure translational motion. Its motion is translational plus 'something else.' In order to understand what this 'something else' is, let us take a rigid body so constrained that it cannot have translational motion. The most common way to constrain a rigid body so that it does not have translational motion is to fix it along a straight line. The only possible motion of such a rigid body is rotation. The line or fixed axis about which the body is rotating is its axis of rotation. If you look around, you will come across many examples of rotation about an axis, a ceiling fan, a potter's wheel, a giant wheel in a fair, a merry-go-round and so on. You may notice that in rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis, every particle of the body moves in a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis.

Fig. 6.4 shows the rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed axis (the z-axis of the frame of reference). Note that the circles described by (P_1) and (P_2) may lie in different planes; both these planes, however, are perpendicular to the fixed axis. For any particle on the axis like (P_3), (r=0). Any such particle remains stationary while the body rotates. In some examples of rotation, however, the axis may not be fixed. A prominent example of this kind of rotation is a top spinning in place. We know from experience that the axis of such a spinning top moves around the vertical through its point of contact with the ground, sweeping out a cone. Another simple example of this kind of rotation is the oscillating table fan or a pedestal fan. You may have observed that the axis of rotation of such a fan has an oscillating (sidewise) movement in a horizontal plane about the vertical through the point at which the axis is pivoted. While the fan rotates and its axis moves sidewise, this point is fixed. Thus, in more general cases of rotation, one point and not one line, of the rigid body is fixed. In our study, however, we mostly deal with the simpler and special case of rotation in which one line (i.e. the axis) is fixed. The rolling motion of a cylinder down an inclined plane is a combination of rotation about a fixed axis and translation.

For the case of rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple equations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity. In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as point objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a reasonable duration of time. In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error.

    "content": "The velocity of an object, in general, changes during its course of motion. How to describe this change? Should it be described as the rate of change in velocity with distance or with time? This was a problem even in Galileo's time. It was first thought that this change could be described by the rate of change of velocity with distance. But, through his studies of motion of freely falling objects and motion of objects on an inclined plane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change of velocity with time is a constant of motion for all objects in free fall. On the other hand, the change in velocity with distance is not constant - it decreases with the increasing distance of fall. This led to the concept of acceleration as the rate of change of velocity with time. The average acceleration a over a time interval is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time interval: $\\overline{a}=\\frac{v_{2}-v_{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$ (2.2) where $V_{2}$ and $V_{1}$ are the instantaneous velocities or simply velocities at time $t_{2}$ $t_{1}$. It is the average change of velocity per unit time. The SI unit of acceleration is $S^{-2}$. On a plot of velocity versus time, the average acceleration is the slope of the straight line connecting the points corresponding to (vâ, tâ) and $(V_{1},t_{1})$. Instantaneous acceleration is defined in the same way as the instantaneous velocity: $a=lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{dv}{dt}$ (2.3) The acceleration at an instant is the slope of the tangent to the $v-t$ curve at that instant.

Position-time graphs for motion with positive, negative and zero acceleration are shown in Figs. 2.4 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. Note that the graph curves upward for positive acceleration: downward for negative acceleration and it is a straight line for zero acceleration. Although acceleration can vary with time. our study in this chapter will be restricted to motion with constant acceleration. In this case, the average acceleration equals the constant value of acceleration during the interval. If the velocity of an object is $V_{p}$ at t $=0$ and vat time t, we have or, $v=v_{0}+at$. An interesting feature of a velocity-time graph for any moving object is that the area under the curve represents the displacement over a given time interval. A general proof of this statement requires use of calculus. We can, however, see that it is true for the simple case of an object moving with constant velocity u. Its velocity-time graph is as shown in Fig. 2.4. The v-t curve is a straight line parallel to the time axis and the area under it between $t=0$ and $t=T$ is the area of the rectangle of height u and base T. Therefore, area $=u\\times T=$ uT which is the displacement in this time interval. How come in this case an area is equal to a distance? Think!

As explained in the previous section, the area under v-t curve represents the displacement. Therefore, the displacement x of the object is: $x=\\frac{1}{2}(v-v_{0})t+v_{0}t$ But $v-v_{0}=at$. Therefore, $x=\\frac{1}{2}a~t^{2}+v_{0}t$ or, $x=v_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$ (2.5) Equation (2.5) can also be written as $x=\\frac{v+v_{0}}{2}t=\\overline{v}t$ (2.6) where, $\\overline{v}=\\frac{v+v_{0}}{2}$ (constant acceleration only) (2.7b) Equations (2.7a) and (2.7b) mean that the object has undergone displacement x with an average velocity equal to the arithmetic average of the initial and final velocities.

If the ball rises to height y from the point of launch, then using the equation $v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2a(y-y_{0})$ we get $0=(20)^{2}+2(-10)(y-y_{0})$. Solving, we get. $(y-y_{0})=20$ m.\n(b) We can solve this part of the problem in two ways. Note carefully the methods used. FIRST METHOD: In the first method, we split the path in two parts: the upward motion (A to B) and the downward motion (B to C) and calculate the corresponding time taken $t_{i}$ and $t_{2}.$ Since the velocity at B is zero, we have: $v=v_{0}+at$ Or, $0=20-10t_{1}$ $t_{1}=2$ s. This is the time in going from A to B. From B, or the point of the maximum height, the ball falls freely under the acceleration due to gravity. The ball is moving in negative y direction. We use equation $y=y_{0}+v_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$. We have, $y_{0}=45m.$ $y=0,$ $v_{0}=0$ $a=-g=-10ms^{-2}$. $0=45+(\\frac{1}{2})(-10)t^{2}$. Solving, we get $t_{2}=3$ s. Therefore, the total time taken by the ball before it hits the ground $=t_{1}+t_{2}=2~s+3~s=5~s$. SECOND METHOD: The total time taken can also be calculated by noting the coordinates of initial and final positions of the ball with respect to the origin chosen and using equation $y=y_{0}+v_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$. Now $y_{0}=25~m$ $y=0~m$. $v_{o}=20ms^{-1}$, $a=-10m~s^{-2}$, $t=?$. $0=25+20t+(\\frac{1}{2})$ (-10) tÂ². Or. $5t^{2}-20t-25=0$. Solving this quadratic equation for t, we get $t=5s$.

The magnitude of acceleration due to gravity is represented by g. If air resistance is neglected, the object is said to be in free fall. If the height through which the object falls is small compared to the earth's radius, g can be taken to be constant, equal to $9.8~m~s^{-2}$ Free fall is thus a case of motion with uniform acceleration. We assume that the motion is in y-direction, more correctly in-y-direction because we choose upward direction as positive. Since the acceleration due to gravity is always downward, it is in the negative direction and we have $a=-g=-9.8~m~s^{-2}$. The object is released from rest at $y=0$ Therefore, $v_{0}=0$ and the equations of motion become: $v=0-gt=-9.8~t$ msÂ¹. $y=0-\\frac{1}{2}g~t^{2}=-4.9~t^{2}$ $v^{2}=0-2~g~y=-19.6~y$ $m^{2}s^{-2}$.

Thus, the stopping distance is proportional to the square of the initial velocity. Doubling the initial velocity increases the stopping distance by a factor of 4 (for the same deceleration). For the car of a particular make, the braking distance was found to be 10 m, 20 m, 34 m and 50 m corresponding to velocities of 11, 15, 20 and $25~m/s$ which are nearly consistent with the above formula.

Reaction time depends on complexity of the situation and on an individual. You can measure your reaction time by a simple experiment.

Assuming an elastic collision and that friction and rotational motion are negligible, obtain $\\theta_1$.\n\n**Answer**\nFrom momentum conservation, (v_{1i}=v_{1f}+v_{2f}) since (m_1=m_2). Squaring this gives (v_{1i}^2=v_{1f}^2+v_{2f}^2+2v_{1f}v_{2f}\\cos(\\theta_1+\\theta_2)). From conservation of kinetic energy for an elastic collision, (v_{1i}^2=v_{1f}^2+v_{2f}^2). Comparing these two equations, we find that (2v_{1f}v_{2f}\\cos(\\theta_1+\\theta_2)=0). Since the velocities are non-zero, this implies (\\cos(\\theta_1+\\theta_2)=0), so (\\theta_1+\\theta_2=90^{\\circ}). Given (\\theta_2=37^{\\circ}), we find (\\theta_1=53^{\\circ}). This proves that for a glancing elastic collision between two equal masses, one initially at rest, they will move at right angles to each other after the collision.",

A force is conservative if the work it does is path-independent, or if the work done over a closed loop is zero. For a conservative force in one dimension, a potential energy function (V(x)) can be defined such that (F(x)=-\\frac{dV(x)}{dx}).\n3. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical energy ((E=K+V)) of a body remains constant if the only forces doing work on it are conservative.\n4. The gravitational potential energy of a particle of mass m at height x is (V(x)=mgx). The elastic potential energy of a spring with force constant k and extension x is (V(x)=\\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}).\n5. The scalar or dot product of two vectors A and B is a scalar quantity defined as (A\\cdot B=AB\\cos\\theta). The scalar product of unit vectors is: (\\hat{i}\\cdot\\hat{i}=\\hat{j}\\cdot\\hat{j}=\\hat{k}\\cdot\\hat{k}=1) and (\\hat{i}\\cdot\\hat{j}=\\hat{j}\\cdot\\hat{k}=\\hat{k}\\cdot\\hat{i}=0).\n6. Power is the rate at which work is done, (P=\\frac{dW}{dt}), and can be expressed as the dot product of force and velocity, (P=F\\cdot v). Its SI unit is the watt (W).\n7. In all collisions, total linear momentum is conserved. In an elastic collision, total kinetic energy is also conserved. In a completely inelastic collision, the two bodies stick together.",
