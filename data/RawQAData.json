    "answer": "In earlier time scientists of different countries were using different systems of units for measurement. Three such systems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS system were in use extensively till recently. The base units for length, mass and time in these systems were as follows : In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second respectively. In FPS system they were foot, pound and second respectively. In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second respectively. The system of units which is at present internationally accepted for measurement is the Systeme Internationale d' Unites (French for International System of Units), abbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols, units and abbreviations, developed by the Bureau International des Poids et measures (The International Bureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM) in 1971 were recently revised by the General Conference on Weights and Measures in November 2018. The scheme is now forinternational usage in scientific, technical, industrial and commercial work. Because SI units used decimal system, conversions within the system are quite simple and convenient.

  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of Significant Figures",
    "answer": "As discussed above, every measurement involves errors. Thus, the result of measurement should be reported in a way that indicates the precision of measurement. Normally, the reported result of measurement is a number that includes all digits in the number that are known reliably plus the first digit that is uncertain. The reliable digits plus the first uncertain digit are known as _significant digits_ or _significant figures_. If we say the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are reliable and certain, while the digit 2 is uncertain. Thus, the measured value has three significant figures. The length of an object reported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are certain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly, reporting the result of measurement that includes more digits than the significant digits is superfluous and also misleading since it would give a wrong idea about the precision of measurement. The rules for determining the number of significant figures can be understood from the following examples. Significant figures indicate, as already mentioned, the precision of measurement which depends on the least count of the measuring instrument. **A choice of change of different units does not change the number of significant digits or figures in a measurement.** This important remark makes most of the following observations clear: (1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four significant figures. But in different units, the same value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08 mm or 23080 m. All these numbers have the same number of significant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four. The example gives the following rules : * **All the non-zero digits are significant.** * **All the zeros between two non-zero digits are significant, no matter where the decimal point is, if at all.** * **If the number is less than 1, the zero(s) on the right of decimal point but to the left of the first non-zero digit are not significant.** [In 0.00 2308, the underlined zeroes are not significant]. * **The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a number without a decimal point are not significant.** [Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has three significant figures, the trailing zero(s) being not significant.] However, you can also see the next observation. * **The trailing zero(s) in a number with a decimal point are significant.** [The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four significant figures each.] (2) There can be some confusion regarding the trailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to be 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here are meant to convey the precision of measurement and are, therefore, significant. [If these were not, it would be superfluous to write them explicitly, the reported measurement would have been simply 4.7 m], Now suppose we change units, then 4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km Since the last number has trailing zero(s) in a number with no decimal, we would conclude erroneously from observation (1) above that the number has _two_ significant figures, while in fact, it has four significant figures and a mere change of units cannot change the number of significant figures. (3) **To remove such ambiguities in determining the number of significant figures, the best way is to report every measurement in scientific notation (in the power of 10).** In this notation, every number is expressed as a * 10^b, where a is a number between 1 and 10, and b is any positive or negative exponent (or power) of 10. In order to get an approximate idea of the number, we may round off the number a to 1 (for a ≤ 5) and to 10 (for 5 < a ≤ 10). Then the number can be expressed approximately as 10^b in which the exponent (or power) b of 10 is called **order of magnitude** of the physical quantity. When only an estimate is required, the quantity is of the order of 10^b. For example, the diameter of the earth (1.28 *  10^7m) is of the order of 10^7m with the order of magnitude 7. The diameter of hydrogen atom (1.06 * 10^(-10)m) is of the order of 10^(-10)m, with the order of magnitude -10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders of magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom. It is often customary to write the decimal after the first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in (a) above disappears : 4.700 m = 4.700 * 10^2 cm = 4.700 * 10^3 mm = 4.700 * 10^3 km The power of 10 is irrelevant to the determination of significant figures. However, all zeroes appearing in the base number in the scientific notation are significant. Each number in this case has four significant figures. Thus, in the scientific notation, no confusion arises about the trailing zero(s) in the base number a. They are always significant. (4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting measurement. But if this is not adopted, we use the rules adopted in the preceding example : * **For a number greater than 1, without any decimal, the trailing zero(s) are not significant.** * **For a number with a decimal, the trailing zero(s) are significant.** (5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a decimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250) is never significant. However, the zeroes at the end of such number are significant in a measurement. (6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are neither rounded numbers nor numbers representing measured values are exact and have infinite number of significant digits. For example in r = d/2 or s = 2 * pi * r, the factor 2 is an exact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00 or 2.0000 as required. Similarly, in T = t/n, n is an exact number.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Rules for Arithmetic Operations with Significant Figures",
    "answer": "The result of a calculation involving approximate measured values of quantities (i.e. values with limited number of significant figures) must reflect the uncertainties in the original measured values. It cannot be more accurate than the original measured values themselves on which the result is based. In general, the final result should not have more significant figures than the original data from which it was obtained. Thus, if mass of an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and its volume is measured to be 2.51 cm^3, then its density, by mere arithmetic division, is 1.68804780876 g/cm^3 upto 11 decimal places. It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant to record the calculated value of density to such a precision when the measurements on which the value is based, have much less precision. The following rules for arithmetic operations with significant figures ensure that the final result of a calculation is shown with the precision that is consistent with the precision of the input measured values : (1) **In multiplication or division, the final result should retain as many significant figures as are there in the original number with the least significant figures**. Thus, in the example above, density should be reported to three significant figures. Density = (4.237 g)/(2.51 cm^3) = 1.69 g cm^(-3) Similarly, if the speed of light is given as 3.00 * 10^8 m s^(-1) (three significant figure) and one year (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557 * 10^7 s (five significant figures), the light year is 9.47 * 10^15 m (three significant figures). (2) **In addition or subtraction, the final result should retain as many decimal places as are there in the number with the least decimal places**. For example, the sum of the numbers 436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic addition, is 663.821 g. But the least precise measurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one decimal place. The final result should, therefore, be rounded off to 663.8 g. Similarly, the difference in length can be expressed as : 0.307 m - 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 * 10^(-3) m. Note that we should not use the rule (1) applicable for multiplication and division and write 664 g as the result in the example of **addition** and 3.00 * 10^(-3) m in the eample of **subtraction**. They do not convey the precision of measurement properly. For addition and subtraction, the rule is in terms of decimal places.",

    "answer": "The result of computation with approximate numbers, which contain more than one uncertain digit, should be rounded off. The rules for rounding off numbers to the appropriate significant figures are obvious in most cases. A number 2.746 rounded off, to three significant figures is 2,75, while the number 1.743 would be 1.74. The rule by convention is that the **preceding digit is raised by 1 if the insignificant digit to be dropped (the underlined digit in this case) is more than 5, and is left unchanged if the latter is less than 5**. But what if the number is 2.745 in which the insignificant digit is 5. Here, the convention is that **if the preceding digit is even, the insignificant digit is simply dropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit is raised by 1**. Then, the number 2.745 rounded off to three significant figures becomes 1.74. On the other hand, the number 2.735 rounded off to three significant figures becomes 1.74 since the preceding digit is odd. In any involved or complex multi-step calculation, you should retain, in intermediate steps, one digit more than the significant digits and round off to proper significant figures at the end of the calculation. Similarly, a number known to be within many significant figures, such as in 2.99792458 * 10^8 m/s for the speed of light in vacuum, is rounded off to an approximate value 3 * 10^8 m/s, which is often employed in computations. Finally, remember that exact numbers that appear in formulae like · 2 pi in T = 2 * pi sqrt(L/g), have a large (infinite) number of significant figures. The value of pi = 3.1415926 is known to a large number of significant figures. You may take the value as 3.142 or 3.14 for pi, with limited number of significant figures as required in specific cases. Each side of a cube is measured to be 7.203 m. What are the total surface area and the volume of the cube to appropriate significant figures? The number of significant figures in the measured length is 4. The calculated area and the volume should therefore be rounded off to 4 significant figures. Surface area of the cube = 6 * (7.203)^2 m^2 = 311.299254 m^2 = 311.3 m^2 Volume of the cube = (7.203)^3 m^3 = 373.714754 m^3 = 373.7 m^3 There are 3 significant figures in the measured mass whereas there are only 2 significant figures in the measured volume. Hence the density should be expressed to only 2 significant figures. Density = (5.74)/(1.2) g cm^(-3) = 4.8 g cm^(-3)",

  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of Rules for Determining the Uncertainty in the Results of Arithmetic Calculations",
    "answer": "The rules for determining the uncertainty or error in the number/measured quantity in arithmetic operations can be understood from the following examples. (1) If the length and breadth of a thin rectangular sheet are measured, using a metre scale as 16.2 cm and, 10.1 cm respectively, there are three significant figures in each measurement. It means that the length l may be written as l = 16.2 ± 0.1  cm = 16.2 cm ± 0.6 %. Similarly, the breadth b may be written as b = 10.1 ± 0.1 cm = 10.1 cm ± 1 % Then, the error of the product of two (or more) experimental values, using the combination of errors rule, will be l * b = 163.62 cm^2 ± 1.6% = 163.62 ± 2.6 cm^2 This leads us to quote the final result as l * b = 164 ± 3 cm^2 Here 3 cm^2 is the uncertainty or error in the estimation of area of rectangular sheet. (2) **If a set of experimental data is specified to n significant figures, a result obtained by combining the data will also be valid to n significant figures.** However, if data are subtracted, the number of significant figures can be reduced. For example, 12.9 g - 7.06 g, both specified to three significant figures, cannot properly be evaluated as 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as uncertainties in subtraction or addition combine in a different fashion (smallest number of decimal places rather than the number of significant figures in any of the number added or subtracted). (3) **The relative error of a value of number specified to significant figures depends not only on n but also on the number itself.** For example, the accuracy in measurement of mass 1.02 g is ± 0.01 g whereas another measurement 9.89 g is also accurate to ± 0.01 g. The relative error in 1.02 g is = (± 0.01/1.02) * 100 % = ± 1% Similarly, the relative error in 9.89 g is = (± 0.01/9.89) * 100 % = ± 0.1 % Finally, remember that **intermediate results in a multi-step computation should be calculated to one more significant figure in every measurement than the number of digits in the least precise measurement.** These should be justified by the data and then the arithmetic operations may be carried out;otherwise rounding errors can build up. For example, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after rounding off) to the same number of significant figures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of 0.104 calculated to three significant figures is 9.62. However, if we had written 1/9.58 = 0.1044 and then taken the reciprocal to three significant figures, we would have retrieved the original value of 9.58. This example justifies the idea to retain one more extra digit (than the number of digits in the least precise measurement) in intermediate steps of the complex multi-step calculations in order to avoid additional errors in the process of rounding off the numbers.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Dimensions of Physical Quantities",
    "answer": "The nature of a physical quantity is described by its dimensions. All the physical quantities represented by derived units can be expressed in terms of some combination of seven fundamental or base quantities. We shall call these base quantities as the seven dimensions of the physical world, which are denoted with square brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the dimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current [A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous intensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol]. **The dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers (or exponents) to which the base quantities are raised to represent that quantity.** Note that using the square brackets [ ] round a quantity means that we are dealing with 'the dimensions of' the quantity. In mechanics, all the physical quantities can be written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M] and [T]. For example, the volume occupied by an object is expressed as the product of length, breadth and height, or three lengths, Hence the dimensions of volume are [L] * [L] * [L] = [L]^3 = [L]^3. As the volume is independent of mass and time, it is said to possess zero dimension in mass [M^0], zero dimension in time [T^0] and three dimensions in length. Similarly, force, as the product of mass and acceleration, can be expressed as Force = mass * acceleration = mass * (length)/(time)^2 The dimensions of force are ([M] * [L])/[T]^2 = [M * L * T^(-2)]. Thus, the force has one dimension in mass, one dimension in length, and -2 dimensions in time. The dimensions in all other base quantities are zero. Note that in this type of representation, the magnitudes are not considered. It is the quality of the type of the physical quantity that enters. Thus, a change in velocity, initial velocity, average velocity, final velocity, and speed are all equivalent in this context. Since all these quantities can be expressed as length/time, their dimensions are [L]/[T] or [L * T^(-1)].",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Checking the Dimensional Consistency of Equations",
    "answer": "The magnitudes of physical quantities may be added together or subtracted from one another only if they have the same dimensions. In other words, we can add or subtract similar physical quantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to force, or an electric current cannot be subtracted from the thermodynamic temperature. This simple principle called **the principle of homogeneity of dimensions** in an equation is extremely useful in checking the correctness of an equation. If the dimensions of all the terms are not same, the equation is wrong. Hence, if we derive an expression for the length (or distance) of an object, regardless of the symbols appearing in the original mathematical relation, when all the individual dimensions are simplified, the remaining dimension must be that of length. Similarly, if we derive an equation of speed, the dimensions on both the sides of equation, when simplified, must be of length/ time, or [L * T^(-1)]. Dimensions are customarily used as a preliminary test of the consistency of an equation, when there is some doubt about the correctness of the equation. However, the dimensional consistency does not guarantee correct equations. It is uncertain to the extent of dimensionless quantities or functions. The arguments of special functions, such as the trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions must be dimensionless. A pure number, ratio of similar physical quantities, such as angle as the ratio (length/length), refractive index as the ratio (speed of light in vacuum/speed of light in medium) etc., has no dimensions. Now we can test the dimensional consistency or homogeneity of the equation x = x_0 + v_0 * t + (1/2) * a * t^2 for the distance x travelled by a particle or body in time t which starts from the position x_0 with an initial velocity v_0 at time t = 0 and has uniform acceleration a along the direction of motion. The dimensions of each term may be written as [x] = [L] [x_0] = [L] [v_0 * t] = [L * T^(-1)] * [T] = [L] [(1/2) * a * t^2] = [L * T^(-2)] * [T^2] = [L] As each term on the right hand side of this equation has the same dimension, namely that of length, which is same as the dimension of left hand side of the equation, hence this equation is a dimensionally correct equation. It may be noted that a test of consistency of dimensions tells us no more and no less than a test of consistency of units, but has the advantage that we need not commit ourselves to a particular choice of units, and we need not worry about conversions among multiples and sub-multiples of the units. It may be borne in mind that **if an equation fails this consistency test, it is proved wrong, but if it passes, it is not proved right. Thus, a dimensionally correct equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong (incorrect) or inconsistent equation must be wrong**. **Example 1.3**: Let us consider an equation 1/2 * m * v^2 = m * g * h where m is the mass of the body, v its velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity and h is the height. Check whether this equation is dimensionally correct. **Answer**: The dimensions of LHS are [M] * [L * T^(-1)]^2 = [M] * [L^2 * T^(-2)] = [M * L^2 * T^(-2)] The dimensions of RHS are [M] * [L * T^(-2)] * [L] = [M] * [L^2 * T^(-2)] = [M * L^2 * T^(-2)] The dimensions of LHS and RHS are the same and hence the equation is dimensionally correct. The SI unit of energy is J = kg m^2 s^(-2); that of speed is  m s^(-1) and of acceleration a is m s^(-2). Which of the formulae for kinetic energy (K) given below can you rule out on the basis of dimensional arguments (m stands for the mass of the body) : (a) K = m^2 * v^3 (b) K = (1/2) * m^2 (c) K = m^2 (d) K = (3/16) * m^2 (e) K = (1/2) * mv^2 + ma _Answer_ Every correct formula or equation must have the same dimensions on both sides of the equation. Also, only quantities with the same physical dimensions can be added or subtracted. The dimensions of the quantity on the right side are [M^2 * L^3 * T^(-3)] for (a); [M * L^2 * T^(-2)] for (b) and (d); [M * L * T^(-2)] for (c). The quantity on the right side of (e) has no proper dimensions since two quantities of different dimensions have been added. Since the kinetic energy K has the dimensions of [M * L^2 * T^(-2)], formulas (a), (c) and (e) are ruled out. Note that dimensional arguments cannot tell which of the two, (b) or (d), is the correct formula. For this, one must turn to the actual definition of kinetic energy (see Chapter 5). The correct formula for kinetic energy is given by (b).",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Deducing Relation among the Physical Quantities",
    "answer": "The method of dimensions can sometimes be used to deduce relation among the physical quantities. For this we should know the dependence of the physical quantity on other quantities (upto three physical quantities or linearly independent variables) and consider it as a product type of the dependence. Let us take an example. **Example 1.5**: Consider a simple pendulum,having a bob attached to a string, that oscillates under the action of the force of gravity. Suppose that the period of  oscillation  of  the  simple  pendulum depends on its length(l), mass of the bob(m) and acceleration due to gravity(g).Derive the expression for its time period using method of dimensions. _Answer_  The dependence of time period T on the quantities l, g and m as a product may be written as : T = k * l^x * g^y * m^z where k is dimensionless constant and x, y and z are the exponents. By considering dimensions on both sides, we have [L^0 * M^0 * T^1] = [L^1]^x * [L^1 * T^(-2)]^y * [M^1]^z = L^(x+y) * T^(–2 * y)  M^z On equating the dimensions on both sides,we have x + y = 0; –2y = 1; and z = 0 So that x = 1/2,y = -1/2,z = 0 Then, T = k * l^(1/2) *  g^(-1/2) or, T = k * sqrt(l/q) Note that value of constant k can not be obtained by the method of dimensions. Here it does not matter if some number multiplies the right side of this formula, because that does not affect its dimensions. Actually, k = 2 * pi so that T =  2 * pi * sqrt(l/g) Dimensional analysis is very useful in deducing relations  among  the  interdependent  physical quantities. However, dimensionless constants cannot be obtained by this method. The method of  dimensions  can  only  test  the  dimensional validity, but not  the exact relationship between physical quantities in any equation. It does not distinguish  between  the  physical  quantities having same dimensions. ## Summary * Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities. Certain physical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity). * Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly standardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela). The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units. * Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a combination of the base units and are called derived units. A complete set of units, both fundamental and derived, is called a system of units. * The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present internationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world. * The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and the derived quantities obtained from them. Certain derived units are expressed by means of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc). * The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m for metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.). * Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific notation, with powers of 10. Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify measurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision of the numbers. * Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical quantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for expressing properly the physical quantities and measurements. * In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the relationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired units are obtained. * In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained. Rules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic operations with them, and 'rounding off' the uncertain digits must be followed. * The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe the nature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the dimensional consistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical quantities, etc. A dimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation must be wrong.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Scalars and Vectors",
    "answer": "In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or vectors. Basically, the difference is that a **direction** is associated with a vector but not with a scalar. A scalar quantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified completely by a sin()gle number, along with the proper unit. Examples are : the distance between two points, mass of an object, the temperature of a body and the time at which a certain event happened. The rules for combining scalars are the rules of ordinary algebra. Scalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and dividedjust as the ordinary numbers*. For example, if the length and breadth of a rectangle are 1.0 m and 0.5 m respectively, then its perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the four sides, 1.0 m + 0.5 m +1.0 m + 0.5 m = 3.0 m. The length of each side is a scalar and the perimeter is also a scalar. Take another example: the maximum and minimum temperatures on a particular day are 35.6 C and 24.2 C respectively. Then, the difference between the two temperatures is 11.4 C. Similarly, if a uniform solid cube of aluminium of side 10 cm has a mass of 2.7 kg, then its volume is 10-3 m3 (a scalar) and its density is 2.7 * 10^3 kg m^-3 (a scalar). A **vector** quantity is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction and obeys the **triangle law of addition** or equivalently the **parallelogram law of addition**. So, a vector is specified by giving its magnitude by a number and its direction. Some physical quantities that are represented by vectors are displacement, velocity, acceleration and force. To represent a vector, we use a bold face type in this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be represented by a symbol **v**. sin()ce bold face is difficult to produce, when written by hand, a vector is often represented by an arrow placed over a letter, say vector(v). Thus, both **v** and vector(v) represent the velocity vector. The magnitude of a vector is often called its absolute value, indicated by magnitude(vector(v)) = v. Thus, a vector is represented by a bold face, e.g. by **A, a, p, q, r,... x, y**, with respective magnitudes denoted by light face _A, a, p, q, r,... x, y_.",

The length of the vector **r** represents the magnitude of the vector and its direction is the direction in which P lies as seen from O. If the object moves from P to P', the vector **PP**' (with tail at P and tip at P') is called the **displacement vector** corresponding to motion from point P (at time _t_) to point P' (at time t'). Figure 3.1: (a) Position and displacement vectors. (b) Displacement vector**PQ** and different courses of motion. It is important to note that displacement vector is the straight line joining the initial and final positions and does not depend on the actual path undertaken by the object between the two positions. For example, in Fig. 3.1(b), given the initial and final positions as P and Q, the displacement vector is the same **PQ** for different paths of journey, say PABCQ, PDQ, and PBEFQ. Therefore, the **magnitude of displacement is either less or equal to the path length of an object between two points**. This fact was emphasised in the previous chapter also while discussin()g motion along a straight line.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Addition and Subtraction of Vectors - Graphical Method",
    "answer": "As mentioned in section 4.2, vectors, by definition, obey the triangle law or equivalently, the parallelogram law of addition. We shall now describe this law of addition usin()g the graphical method. Let us consider two vectors **A** and **B** that lie in a plane as shown in Fig. 3.4(a). The lengths of the line segments representing these vectors are proportional to the magnitude of the vectors. To find the sum **A**+ **B**, we place vector**B** so that its tail is at the head of the vector **A**, as in Fig. 3.4(b). Then, we join the tail of **A** to the head of **B**. This line OQ represents a vector **R**, that is, the sum of the vectors **A** and **B**. sin()ce, in this procedure of vector addition, vectors are arranged head to tail, this graphical method is called the **head-to-tail method**. The two vectors and their resultant form three sides of a triangle, so this method is also known as **triangle method of vector addition**. If we find the resultant of **B** + **A** as in Fig. 3.4(c), the same vector **R** is obtained. Thus, vector addition is **commutative**: **A** + **B** = **B** + **A** (3.1) The addition of vectors also obeys the associative law as illustrated in Fig. 3.4(d). The result of adding vectors **A** and **B** first and then adding vector **C** is the same as the result of adding **B** and **C** first and then adding **A**: (**A** + **B**) + **C** = **A** + (**B** + **C**) What is the result of adding two equal and opposite vectors? Consider two **A** and -**A** shown in Fig. 3.3(b). Their sum is **A** + -**A**. sin()ce the magnitudes of the two vectors are the same, but the directions are opposite, the resultant vector has zero magnitude and is represented by **o** called a **null vector** or a **zero vector** : **A** - **A** = **o** sin()ce the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its direction cannot be specified. The null vector also results when we multiply a vector **A** by the number zero. The main properties of **o** are : **A** + **o** = **A** lambda * **O** = **O** O * **A** = **O** What is the physical meaning of a zero vector? Consider the position and displacement vectors in a plane as shown in Fig. 3.1(a). Now suppose that an object which is at P at time t, moves to P' and then comes back to P. Then, what is its displacement? sin()ce the initial and final positions coincide, the displacement is a \"null vector\". **Subtraction of vectors** can be defined in terms of addition of vectors. We define the difference of two vectors **A** and **B** as the sum of two vectors **A** and **-B** : **A** - **B** = **A** + (-**B**) (3.5) It is shown in Fig 3.5. The vector **-B** is added to vector **A** to get **R_2** = (**A** - **B**). The vector **R_1** = **A** + **B** is also shown in the same figure for comparison. We can also use the **parallelogram method** to find the sum of two vectors. Suppose we have two vectors **A** and **B**. To add these vectors, we bring their tails to a common origin O as shown in Fig. 3.6(a). Then we draw a line from the head of **A** parallel to **B** and another line from the head of **B** parallel to **A** to complete a parallelogram OQSP. Now we join the point of the intersection of these two lines to the origin O. The resultant vector **R** is directed from the common origin O along the diagonal (OS) of the parallelogram [Fig. 3.6(b)]. In Fig.3.6(c), the triangle law is used to obtain the resultant of **A** and **B** and we see that the two methods yield the same result. Thus, the two methods are equivalent. Figure 3.5: (a) Two vectors **A** and **B**, **-B** is also shown. (b) Subtracting vector **B** from vector **A** – the result is **R_2**. For comparison, addition of vectors **A** and **B**, i.e. **R_1** is also shown. Figure 3.6: (a) Two vectors A and B with their tails brought to a common origin. (b) The sum **A** + **B** obtained usin()g the parallelogram method. (c) The parallelogram method of vector addition is equivalent to the triangle method. **Example 3.1**: Rain is falling vertically with a speed of 35 m s^-1. Winds starts blowing after sometime with a speed of 12 m s^-1 in east to west direction. In which direction should a boy waiting at a bus stop hold his umbrella? **Answer**: The velocity of the rain and the wind are represented by the vectors **v_r** and **V_w** in Fig. 3.7 and are in the direction specified by the problem. Usin()g the rule of vector addition, we see that the resultant of **V_r** and **V_w** is **R** as shown in the figure. The magnitude of **R** is R = sqrt(v_r^2 + v_w^2) = sqrt(35^2 + 12^2) m s^-1 = 37 m s^-1 The direction theta that R makes with the vertical is given by tan(theta) = v_w / v_r = 12/35 = 0.343 Or, theta = tan^-1(0.343) = 19^° Therefore, the boy should hold his umbrella in the vertical plane at an angle of about 19^° with the vertical towards the east.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Resolution of Vectors",
    "answer": "Let **a** and **b** be any two non-zero vectors in a plane with different directions and let **A** be another vector in the same plane (Fig. 3.8). **A** can be expressed as a sum of two vectors -- one obtained by multiplying **a** by a real number and the other obtained by multiplying **b** by another real number. To see this, let O and P be the tail and head of the vector **A**. Then, through O, draw a straight line parallel to **a**, and through P, a straight line parallel to **b**. Let them intersect at Q. Then, we have **A** = O * P = O * **Q** + **Q** * P But sin()ce O * **Q** is parallel to **a**, and **Q** * P is parallel to **b**, we can write : O * **Q** = lambda * **a**, and **Q** * P = mu * **b** where lambda and mu are real numbers. Therefore, **A** = lambda * **a** + mu * **b** (3.8) Figure 3.8: (a) Two non-colinear vectors a and b. (b) Resolving a vector A in terms of vectors a and b. We say that **A** has been resolved into two component vectors lambda * **a** and mu * **b** along **a** and **b** respectively. Usin()g this method one can resolve a given vector into two component vectors along a set of two vectors - all the three lie in the same plane. It is convenient to resolve a general vector along the axes of a rectangular coordinate system usin()g vectors of unit magnitude. These are called unit vectors that we discuss now. A unit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and points in a particular direction. It has no dimension and unit. It is used to specify a direction only. Unit vectors along the x-, y- and z-axes of a rectangular coordinate system are denoted by i_hat, j_hat and k_hat, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3.9(a). sin()ce these are unit vectors, we have magnitude(i_hat) = magnitude(j_hat) = magnitude(k_hat) = 1       (3.9) These unit vectors are perpendicular to each other. In this text, they are printed in bold face with a cap (^) to distinguish them from other vectors. sin()ce we are dealing with motion in two dimensions in this chapter, we require use of only two unit vectors. If we multiply a unit vector, say n_hat by a scalar, the result is a vector: lambda = lambda * n_hat In general, a vector A can be written as A = magnitude(A) * n_hat  (Equation 3.10) where n_hat is a unit vector along **A**. We can now resolve a vector **A** in terms of component vectors that lie along unit vectors i_hat and j_hat. Consider a vector **A** that lies in the x-y plane as shown in Fig. 3.9(b). We draw lines from the head of **A** perpendicular to the coordinate axes as in Fig. 3.9(b), and get vectors A₁ and A₂ such that **A_1** + **A_2** = **A** and A2 is parallel to j_hat, we have: **A_1** = A_x i_hat, **A_2** = A_y j_hat where A_x and A_y are real numbers. Thus, **A** = A_x i_hat + A_y j_hat This is represented in Fig. 3.9(c). The quantities A_x and A_y are called x- and y-components of the vector A. Note that A_x is itself not a vector, but A_x i_hat is a vector, and so is A_y j_hat. Usin()g simple trigonometry, we can express A_x and A_y in terms of the magnitude of A and the angle theta it makes with the x-axis: A_x = A * cos(theta) A_y = A * sin()(theta)        (Equation 3.13) As is clear from Eq. (3.13), a component of a vector can be positive, negative or zero depending on the value of theta. Now, we have two ways to specify a vector A in a plane. It can be specified by: (i) its magnitude A and the direction theta it makes with the x-axis; or (ii) its components A_x and A_y. If A and theta are given, A_x and A_y can be obtained usin()g Eq. (3.13). If A_x and A_y are given, A and theta can be obtained as follows: A_x^2 + A_y^2 = A^2 * cos^2(theta) + A^2 * sin()^2(theta) = A^2 ⇒ A = sqrt(A_x^2 + A_y^2)         (Equation 3.14) And tan(theta) = A_y / A_x theta = tan^-1(A_y / A_x)         (Equation 3.15) So far we have considered a vector lying in an x-y plane. The same procedure can be used to resolve a general vector A into three components along x-, y-, and z-axes in three dimensions. If alpha, beta, and gamma are the angles between A and the x-, y-, and z-axes respectively, then we have: A_x = A * cos(alpha) A_y = A * cos(beta) A_z = A * cos(gamma)        (Equation 3.16a) In general, we have: A = A_x * i_hat + A_y * j_hat + A_z * k_hat        (Equation 3.16b) The magnitude of vector A is: A = sqrt(A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2)        (Equation 3.16c) A position vector r can be expressed as: r = x * i_hat + y * j_hat + z * k_hat        (Equation 3.17) where x, y, and z are the components of r along x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Vector Addition Analytical Method",
    "answer": "Although the graphical method of adding vectors helps us in visualisin()g the vectors and the resultant vector, it is sometimes tedious and has limited accuracy. It is much easier to add vectors by combining their respective components. Consider two vectors **A** and **B** in x-y plane with components A_x, A_Y and B_X, B_Y : **A** = A_x i_hat + A_y j_hat **B** = B_x i_hat + B_y j_hat Let **R** be their sum. We have **R** = **A** + **B**  = (A_x i_hat + A_y j_hat) + (B_x i_hat + B_y j_hat) sin()ce vectors obey the commutative and associative laws, we can arrange and regroup the vectors in Eq. (3.19a) as convenient to us : **R** = (A_x + B_x) i_hat + (A_y + B_y) j_hat sin()ce **R** = R_x i_hat + R_y j_hat we have, R_x = A_x + B_x, R_y = A_y + B_y    (3.21) Thus, each component of the resultant vector **R** is the sum of the corresponding components of **A** and **B**. In three dimensions, we have **A** = A_x i_hat + A_y j_hat + A_z k_hat **B** = B_x i_hat + B_y j_hat + B_z k_hat **R** = **A** + **B** = R_x i_hat + R_y j_hat + R_z k_hat with R_x = A_x + B_x R_y = A_y + B_y R_x = A_z + B_z This method can be extended to addition and subtraction of any number of vectors. For example, if vectors **a**, **b** and **c** are given as **a** = a_x i_hat + a_y j_hat + a_z k_hat **b** = b_x i_hat + b_y j_hat + b_z k_hat **c** = c_x i_hat + c_y j_hat + c_z k_hat then, a vector \\**T** = **a** + **b** - **c** has components : T_x = a_x + b_x - c_x T_y = a_y + b_y - c_y T_z = a_z + b_z - c_z **Example 3.2**: Find the magnitude and direction of the resultant of two vectors **A** and **B** in terms of their magnitudes and angle theta between them. _Answer_ Let **OP** and **OO** represent the two vectors **A** and **B** making an angle theta (Fig. 3.10). Then, usin()g the parallelogram method of vector addition, **OS** represents the resultant vector **R** : **R** = **A** + **B** *SN* is normal to *OP* and *PM* is normal to *OS*. From the geometry of the figure, OS^2 = ON^2 + SN^2 But, ON = OP + PN = A + B * cos(theta) SN = B * sin()(theta) So, OS^2 = (A + B * cos(theta))^2 + (B * sin()(theta))^2 R^2 = A^2 + B^2 + 2AB * cos(theta) Therefore, the magnitude of the resultant is: **R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2 + 2 * A * B * cos(theta))**   (Equation 3.24a) In ΔOSN, SN = OS * sin()(alpha) = R * sin()(alpha) In ΔPSN, SN = PS * sin()(theta) = B * sin()(theta) Therefore, **R * sin()(alpha) = B * sin()(theta)** or, **R / sin()(theta) = B / sin()(alpha)**   (Equation 3.24b) Similarly, PM = A * sin()(alpha) = B * sin()(beta) or, **A / sin()(beta) = B / sin()(alpha)**   (Equation 3.24c) Combining Eqs. (3.24b) and (3.24c), we get: **R / sin()(theta) = A / sin()(beta) = B / sin()(alpha)**   (Equation 3.24d) Usin()g Eq. (3.24d), we get: **sin()(alpha) = (B * sin()(theta)) / (A + B * cos(theta))**   (Equation 3.24e) or, **tan(alpha) = (B * sin()(theta)) / (A + B * cos(theta))**   (Equation 3.24f) Equation (3.24a) gives the magnitude of the resultant and Eqs. (3.24e) and (3.24f) its direction. Equation (3.24a) is known as the **Law of Cosin()es** and Eq. (3.24d) as the **Law of sin()es**. **Example 3.3** A motorboat is racing towards north at 25 km/h and the water current in that region is 10 km/h in the direction of 60° east of south. Find the resultant velocity of the boat. **Answer** The vector **v_b**, representing the velocity of the motorboat, and the vector **v_c**, representing the water current, are shown in Fig. 3.11 in directions specified by the problem. Usin()g the parallelogram method of addition, the resultant **R** is obtained in the direction shown in the figure. We can obtain the magnitude of **R** usin()g the Law of Cosin()e: R = sqrt(v_b^2 + v_c^2 + 2 * v_b * v_c * cos(120°)) = sqrt(25^2 + 10^2 + 2 * 25 * 10 * (-1/2)) = sqrt(625 + 100 - 250) = sqrt(475) ≈ 21.8 km/h To obtain the direction, we apply the Law of sin()es: R / sin()(theta) = v_c / sin()(phi) => sin()(phi) = (v_c * sin()(theta)) / R = (10 * sin()(120°)) / 21.8 = (10 * (sqrt(3)/2)) / 21.8 ≈ 8.66 / 21.8 ≈ 0.397 phi ≈ 23.4°",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Position Vector and Displacement",
    "answer": "The position vector **r** of a particle P located in a plane with reference to the origin of an x-y reference frame (Fig. 3.12) is given by **r** = x i_hat + y j_hat where x and y are components of **r** along x-, and y- axes or simply they are the coordinates of the object. Suppose a particle moves along the curve shown by the thick line and is at P at time t and P' at time t' [Fig. 3.12(b)]. Then, the displacement is : Δr = r' – r (3.25) and is directed from P to P'. We can write Eq. (3.25) in a component form: Δr = (x' i_hat + y' j_hat) - (x i_hat + y j_hat) = i_hat Δx + j_hat Δy where Δx = x' - x, Δy = y' - y ## Velocity The average velocity **v̄** of an object is the ratio of the displacement and the corresponding time interval: **v̄ = Δr / Δt = (Δx * i_hat + Δy * j_hat) / Δt = (Δx / Δt) * i_hat + (Δy / Δt) * j_hat**  (Equation 3.27) Or, **v̄ = v̄ₓ * i_hat + v̄ᵧ * j_hat** sin()ce **v̄ = Δr / Δt**, the direction of the average velocity is the same as that of **Δr** (Fig. 3.12). The **velocity** (instantaneous velocity) is given by the limiting value of the average velocity as the time interval approaches zero: **v = lim (Δt tends to 0) (Δr / Δt) = dr / dt**  (Equation 3.28) The meaning of the limiting process can be easily understood with the help of Fig. 3.13(a) to (d). In these figures, the thick line represents the path of an object, which is at **P** at time **t**. **P₁, P₂,** and **P₃** represent the positions of the object after times **Δt₁, Δt₂,** and **Δt₃**, and **Δr₁, Δr₂,** and **Δr₃** are the displacements of the object in times **Δt₁, Δt₂,** and **Δt₃**, respectively. As **Δt₁, Δt₂, Δt₃ tends to0**, **Δr₁, Δr₂, Δr₃ tends to0**, and is along the tangent to the path. Therefore, the direction of velocity at any point on the path of an object is tangential to the path at that point and is in the direction of motion. We can express **v** in a component form: **v = dr / dt = lim (Δt tends to 0) [(Δx i_hat + Δy j_hat) / Δt]**  (Equation 3.29) ** = i_hat lim (Δt tends to 0) (Δx / Δt) + j_hat lim (Δt tends to 0) (Δy / Δt)** ** = i_hat dx / dt + j_hat * dy / dt** Or, **v = dx / dt i_hat + dy / dt j_hat = v_x i_hat + v_y j_hat**  (Equation 3.30a) where **v_x = dx / dt, v_y = dy / dt** So, if the expressions for the coordinates **x** and **y** are known as functions of time, we can use these equations to find **v_x** and **v_y**. The magnitude of **v** is then **v = sqrt(v_x^2 + v_y^2)**  (Equation 3.30b) and the direction of **v** is given by the angle **theta**: **tan(theta) = v_y / v_x = -tan^(-1)(dy / dx)**  (Equation 3.30c) **v_x, v_y** and angle **theta** are shown in Fig. 3.14 for a velocity vector **v** at point **P**. ## Acceleration The average acceleration **ā** of an object for a time interval **Δt** moving in **x-y** plane is the change in velocity divided by the time interval: **ā = Δv / Δt = (Δv_x i_hat + Δv_y j_hat) / Δt = Δv_x / Δt i_hat + Δv_y / Δt j_hat**  (Equation 3.31a) Or, **ā = a_x i_hat + a_y j_hat**  (Equation 3.31b) *In terms of x and y, a_x and a_y can be expressed as:* **a_x = d/dt(dx/dt) = d^2x / dt^2, a_y = d/dt(dy/dt) = d^2y / dt^2** The **acceleration** (instantaneous acceleration) is the limiting value of the average acceleration as the time interval approaches zero: **a = lim (Δt tends to 0) (Δv / Δt)**  (Equation 3.32a) sin()ce **Δv = Δv_x i_hat + Δv_y j_hat**, we have **a = i_hat lim (Δt tends to 0) (Δv_x / Δt) + j_hat lim (Δt tends to 0) (Δv_y / Δt)** Or, **a = a_x i_hat + a_y j_hat**  (Equation 3.32b) where, **a_x = dv_x / dt, a_y = dv_y / dt**  (Equation 3.32c) As in the case of velocity, we can understand graphically the limiting process used in defining acceleration on a graph showing the path of the object’s motion. This is shown in Figs. 3.15(a) to (d). **P** represents the position of the object at time **t**, and **P₁, P₂, P₃** positions after time **Δt₁, Δt₂, Δt₃** respectively (**Δt₁ > Δt₂ > Δt₃**). The velocity vectors at points **P, P₁, P₂, P₃** are also shown in Figs. 3.15 (a), (b), (c), and (d). In each case of **Δt**, **Δv** is obtained usin()g the triangle law of vector addition. By definition, the direction of average acceleration is the same as that of **Δv**. We see that as **Δt** decreases, the direction of **Δv** changes and consequently, the direction of the acceleration changes. Finally, in the limit **Δt tends to0** [Fig. 3.15(d)], the average acceleration becomes the instantaneous acceleration and has the direction as shown. Note that in one dimension, the velocity and the acceleration of an object are always along the same straight line (either in the same direction or in the opposite direction). **However, for motion in two or three dimensions, velocity and acceleration vectors may have any angle between 0° and 180° between them.**",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Motion in a plane with constant acceleration",
    "answer": "Suppose that an object is moving in x-y plane and its acceleration **a** is constant. Over an interval of time, the average acceleration will equal this constant value. Now, let the velocity of the object be **v_o** at time t = 0 and **v** at time t. Then, by definition **a** = (**v - v_0** / t - O) = (**v** - **v_0**) / t Or, **v** = **v_0** + **a** * t In terms of components : v_x = v_0x + a_x * t v_y = v_0y + a_y * t Let us now find how the position **r** changes with time. We follow the method used in the one-dimensional case. Let **r_0** and **r** be the position vectors of the particle at time 0 and t and let the velocities at these instants be v_0 and **v**. Then, over this time interval t, the average velocity is (v_0 + v)/2. The displacement is the average velocity multiplied by the time interval : **r - r_0** = ((**v + v_0**) / 2) * t = (((**v_0 + a** * t ) + v_0) / 2) * t = v_0 * t + 1?2 * a * t^2 Or, **r** = **r_0** + **v_0** * t + 1/2 * **a** * t^2 It can be easily verified that the derivative of Eq. (3.34a), i.e. **dr / dt** gives Eq. (3.33a) and it also satisfies the condition that at *t = 0*, **r = r_0**. Equation (3.34a) can be written in component form as **x = x_0 + v_0x * t + (1 / 2) * a_x * t^2** **y = y_0 + v_0y * t + (1 / 2) * a_y * t^2**  (3.34b) One immediate interpretation of Eq. (3.34b) is that the motions in *x*- and *y*-directions can be treated independently of each other. That is, **motion in a plane** (two-dimensions) can be treated as **two separate simultaneous one-dimensional motions** with constant acceleration along two perpendicular directions. This is an important result and is useful in analysin()g motion of objects in two dimensions. A similar result holds for three dimensions. The choice of perpendicular directions is convenient in many physical situations, as we shall see in section 3.9 for projectile motion. **Example 3.5** A particle starts from origin at *t = 0* with a velocity 5.0 i_hat m/s and moves in x–y plane under action of a force which produces a constant acceleration of **(3.0 i_hat + 2.0 j_hat) m/s^2**. (a) What is the *y*-coordinate of the particle at the instant its *x*-coordinate is 84 m ? (b) What is the speed of the particle at this time ? **Answer** From Eq. (3.34a) for **r_0 = 0**, the position of the particle is given by **r(t) = v_0 * t + (1 / 2) * a * t^2 = 5.0 i_hat + (1 / 2)(3.0 i_hat + 2.0 j_hat) * t^2** = (5.0 * t + 1.5 * t^2) i_hat + 1.0t^2 j_hat** Therefore, **x(t) = 5.0 * t + 1.5 * t^2** **y(t) = 1.0 * t^2** Given **x(t) = 84 m**, t = ? **5.0 * t + 1.5 * t^2 = 84 ⇒ t = 6 s** At **t = 6 s**, **y = 1.0 * (6)^2 = 36.0 m** Now, the velocity **v = dr / dt = (5.0 + 3.0 *t) i_hat + 2.0 * t j_hat** At **t = 6 s**, **v = 23.0 i_hat + 12.0 j_hat** **speed = magnitude(v) = sqrt(23^2 + 12^2) ≅ 26 m/s^-1**",

  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of PROJECTILE MOTION",
    "answer": "As an application of the ideas developed in the previous sections, we consider the motion of a projectile. An object that is in flight after being thrown or projected is called a projectile. Such a projectile might be a football, a cricket ball, a baseball or any other object. The motion of a projectile may be thought of as the result of two separate, simultaneously occurring components of motions. One component is along a horizontal direction without any acceleration and the other along the vertical direction with constant acceleration due to the force of gravity. Galileo who first stated this independency of the horizontal and the vertical components of projectile motion in his *Dialogue on the great world systems* (1632). In our discussion, we shall assume that the air resistance has negligible effect on the motion of the projectile. Suppose that the projectile is launched with velocity **v₀** that makes an angle *theta₀* with the *x*-axis as shown in Fig. 3.16. After the object has been projected, the acceleration acting on it is that due to gravity which is directed vertically downward: **a = -g j_hat** **a_x = 0, a_y = -g**  (3.35) The components of initial velocity **v₀** are: **v_₀ₓ = v_₀ * cos(theta_₀)** **v_₀ᵧ = v_₀ * sin()(theta_₀)**  (3.36) Fig 3.16 Motion of an Object Projected with Velocity *V_0* at Angle *theta_0* If we take the initial position to be the origin of the reference frame as shown in Fig. 3.16, we have: *x_0 = 0*, *y_0 = 0* Then, Eq. (3.34b) becomes: **x = V_0x * t = (V_0 * cos(theta_0)) * t** **y = (V_0 * sin()(theta_0)) * t - (1/2) * g * t^2**  (Equation 3.37) The components of velocity at time *t* can be obtained usin()g Eq. (3.33b): **V_x = V_0x * cos(theta_0)** **V_y = V_0 * sin()(theta_0) - g * t^2**  (Equation 3.38) Equation (3.37) gives the *x*- and *y*-coordinates of the position of a projectile at time *t* in terms of two parameters — initial speed *V_0* and projection angle *theta_0*. Notice that the choice of mutually perpendicular *x*- and *y*-directions for the analysis of the projectile motion has resulted in a simplification. One of the components of velocity, i.e. *x*-component remains constant throughout the motion and only the *y*-component changes, like an object in free fall in vertical direction. This is shown graphically at a few instants in Fig. 3.17. Note that at the point of maximum height, *V_y = 0* and therefore, **theta = tan^-1 (V_y / V_x) = 0** ## Equation of Path of a Projectile What is the shape of the path followed by the projectile? This can be seen by eliminating the time between the expressions for *x* and *y* as given in Eq. (3.37). We obtain: **y = (tan(theta_0)) * x - (g / (2 * (V_0 * cos(theta_0)^2)) * x^2**) (Equation 3.39) Now, sin()ce *g*, *theta_0*, and *V_0* are constants, Eq. (3.39) is of the form *y = a * x + b * x^2*, in which *a* and *b* are constants. This is the equation of a parabola, i.e., the path of the projectile is a parabola (Fig. 3.17). ## Time of Maximum Height How much time does the projectile take to reach the maximum height? Let this time be denoted by *t_m*. sin()ce at this point, *V_y = 0*, we have from Eq. (3.38): **V_y = V_0 * sin()(theta_0) - g * t = 0** Or, **t_m = V_0 * sin()(theta_0) / g**  (Equation 3.40a) The total time *T_f* during which the projectile is in flight can be obtained by putting *y = 0* in Eq. (3.37). We get: **T_f = 2 * (V_0 * sin()(theta_0)) / g**  (Equation 3.40b) *T_f* is known as the time of flight of the projectile. We note that **T_f = 2 * t_m**, which is expected because of the symmetry of the parabolic path. ## Maximum Height of a Projectile The maximum height *h_m* reached by the projectile can be calculated by substituting *t = t_m* in Eq. (3.37): **y = h_m = (V_0 * sin()(theta_0)) * (V_0 * sin()(theta_0) / g) - (g / 2) * (V_0 * sin()(theta_0) / g)^2** Or, **h_m = (V_0^2 * sin()^2(theta_0)) / (2 * g)**  (Equation 3.41) ## Horizontal Range of a Projectile The horizontal distance travelled by a projectile from its initial position (*x = y = 0*) to the position where it passes *y = 0* during its fall is called the horizontal range. The range *R* is the distance travelled during the time of flight *T_f*. Therefore, the range *R* is: **R = (V_0 * cos(theta_0)) * (T_f)** **  = (V_0 * cos(theta_0)) * (2 * V_0 * sin(theta_0) / g)** Or, **R = (V_0^2 * sin(2theta_0) ) / g**  (Equation 3.42a) Equation (3.42a) shows that for a given projection velocity *V_0*, *R* is maximum when *sin() 2theta_0* is maximum, i.e., when *theta_0 = 45°*. The maximum horizontal range is, therefore: **R_m = V_0^2 / g**  (Equation 3.42b) > **Example 3.6** > Galileo, in his book *Two New Sciences*, stated that “for elevations which exceed or fall short of 45° by equal amounts, the ranges are equal.” > **Prove this statement.** **Answer:** For a projectile launched with velocity *V_0* at an angle *theta_0*, the range is given by: **R = (V_0^2 * sin(2theta_0) ) / g** Now, for angles (45° + alpha) and (45° - alpha), 2theta_0 is (90° + 2alpha) and (90° - 2alpha) respectively. The values of sin((90° + 2alpha)) and sin((90° - 2alpha)) are the same, equal to that of cos(2alpha). Therefore, ranges are equal for elevations which exceed or fall short of 45° by equal amounts alpha. **Example 3.7** A hiker stands on the edge of a cliff 490 m above the ground and throws a stone horizontally with an initial speed of 15 m/s. Neglecting air resistance, find the time taken by the stone to reach the ground, and the speed with which it hits the ground. **(Take g = 9.8 m/s^2)* **Answer:** We choose the origin of the *x*- and *y*-axis at the edge of the cliff and *t = 0* at the instant the stone is thrown. Choose the positive direction of *x*-axis to be along the initial velocity and the positive direction of *y*-axis to be the vertically upward direction. The *x*- and *y*-components of the motion can be treated independently. The equations of motion are: **x(t) = x_0 + V_{0x} * t** **y(t) = y_0 + v_{0y} * t + (1/2) * a_y * t^2** Here, *x_0 = y_0 = 0* *v_{0y} = 0*, *a_y = -g = -9.8 m/s^2*, *v_{0x} = 15 m/s* The stone hits the ground when y(t) = -490 m This gives: **-490 = (1/2) * (-9.8) * t^2** Solving: **t = 10 s** The velocity components are: **v_x = v_{0x}** **v_y = v_{0y} - g * t** So when the stone hits the ground: **v_{0x} = 15 m/s** **v_y = 0 - 9.8 * 10 = -98 m/s** Therefore, the speed of the stone is: **sqrt(v_x^2 + v_y^2) = sqrt(15^2 + 98^2) = 99 m/s** **Example 3.8** A cricket ball is thrown at a speed of 28 m/s in a direction 30^° above the horizontal. Calculate: (a) the maximum height (b) the time taken by the ball to return to the same level (c) the distance from the thrower to the point where the ball returns to the same level **Answer:** (a) The maximum height is given by: **h_m = ((v_0 * sin(theta_0))^2) / (2 * g) = (28 * sin(30))^2 / (2 * 9.8) m** **   = (14 * 14) / (2 * 9.8) = 10.0 m** (b) The time taken to return to the same level is: **T_f = (2 * v_0 * sin(theta_0)) / g = (2 * 28 * sin(30)) / 9.8 = 28 / 9.8 ≈ 2.9 s** (c) The distance from the thrower to the point where the ball returns to the same level is: **R = (v_0^2 * sin(2 * theta_0)) / g = (28 * 28 * sin(60)) / 9.8 = 69 m** ## 3.10 Uniform Circular Motion When an object follows a circular path at a constant speed, the motion of the object is called *uniform circular motion*. The word “uniform” refers to the speed, which is uniform (constant) throughout the motion. Suppose an object is moving with uniform speed *v* in a circle of radius *R* as shown in Fig. 3.18. Since the velocity of the object is changing continuously in direction, the object undergoes acceleration. Let us find the magnitude and the direction of this acceleration. Let **r** and **r'** be the position vectors and **v** and **v'** the velocities of the object when it is at point *P* and *P'* as shown in Fig. 3.18(a). By definition, velocity at a point is along the tangent at that point in the direction of motion. The velocity vectors **v** and **v'** are as shown in Fig. 3.18(a1). **Δv** is obtained in Fig. 3.18(a2) using the triangle law of vector addition. Since the path is circular, **v** is perpendicular to **r** and so is **v'** to **r'**. Therefore, **Δv** is perpendicular to **Δr**. Since average acceleration is along **Δv** (**ā = (Δv) / (Δt)**), the average acceleration **ā** is perpendicular to **Δr**. If we place **Δv** on the line that bisects the angle between **r** and **r'**, we see that it is directed towards the centre of the circle. Figure 3.18(b) shows the same quantities for smaller time interval. **Δv** and hence **ā** is again directed towards the centre. In Fig. 3.18(c), Δt tends to 0 and the average acceleration becomes the instantaneous acceleration. It is directed towards the centre. Thus, we find that the acceleration of an object in uniform circular motion is always directed towards the centre of the circle. Let us now find the magnitude of the acceleration. The magnitude of **a** is, by definition, given by: **|a| = lim (Δt tends to 0) (|Δv| / Δt)** Let the angle between **r** and **r'** be *Δtheta*. Since the velocity vectors **v** and **v'** are always perpendicular to the position vectors, the angle between them is also *Δtheta*. Therefore, the triangle CPP' formed by the position vectors and the triangle GHI formed by the velocity vectors **v**, **v'** and **Δv** are similar (Fig. 3.18a). Therefore, the ratio of the base-length to side-length for one of the triangles is equal to that of the other triangle. That is: magnitude(Δv) / v = magnitude(Δr) / R Or, magnitude(Δv) = v * (magnitude(Δr) / R) Therefore, **magnitude(a) = lim (Δt tends to 0) (magnitude(Δv) / Δt)** = **lim (Δt tends to 0) (v * magnitude(Δr) / RΔt)** = **(v / R) * lim (Δt tends to 0) (magnitude(Δr) / Δt)** If *Δt* is small, *Δtheta* will also be small and then arc PP' can be approximately taken to be magnitude(Δr): magnitude(Δr) ≅ v * Δt ⇒ magnitude(Δr) / Δt ≅ v Or, **lim (Δt tends to 0) (magnitude(Δr) / Δt) = v** Therefore, the centripetal acceleration *a_c* is: **a_c = (v / R) * v = v^2 / R**  (3.43) Thus, the acceleration of an object moving with speed *v* in a circle of radius *R* has a magnitude **v^2 / R** and is always directed towards the centre. This is why this acceleration is called *centripetal acceleration* (a term proposed by Newton). A thorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was first published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist **Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695)** but it was probably known to Newton also some years earlier. “Centripetal” comes from a Greek term which means *centre-seeking*. Since *v* and *R* are constant, the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also constant. However, the direction changes — pointing always towards the centre. Therefore, a centripetal acceleration is **not** a constant vector. We have another way of describing the velocity and the acceleration of an object in uniform circular motion. As the object moves from P to P′ in time *Δt (t - t′)*, the line CP (Fig. 3.18) turns through an angle *Δtheta* as shown in the figure. *Δtheta* is called angular distance. We define the *angular speed* *w* (Greek letter omega) as the **time rate of change of angular displacement**: **w = Δtheta / Δt**  (3.44) Now, if the distance travelled by the object during the time *Δt* is *Δs*, i.e., PP′ is *Δs*, then: **v = Δs / Δt** But Δs = R * Δtheta. Therefore: **v = R * (Δtheta / Δt) = R * w** **v = R * w**  (3.45) We can express centripetal acceleration *a_c* in terms of angular speed: **a_c = v² / R = (w² * R²) / R = w² * R** **a_c = w² * R**  (3.46) The time taken by an object to make one revolution is known as its time period **T**, and the number of revolutions made in one second is called its frequency **ν (= 1 / T)**. However, during this time the distance moved by the object is **s = 2 * pie * R**. Therefore, **v = (2 * pie * R) / T = 2 *pie * R * ν**  (3.47) In terms of frequency ν, we have: **w = 2 * pie * ν** **v = 2 * pie * R * ν** **a_c = 4 * pie^2 * v^2 * R**  (3.48) **Example 3.9** An insect trapped in a circular groove of radius 12 cm moves along the groove steadily and completes 7 revolutions in 100 s. (a) What is the angular speed, and the linear speed of the motion? (b) Is the acceleration vector a constant vector? What is its magnitude? **Answer:** This is an example of uniform circular motion. Here **R = 12 cm**. The angular speed **w** is given by: **w = 2 * pie / T = 2 * pie * 7 / 100 = 0.44 rad/s** The linear speed **v** is: **v = w * R = 0.44 * 12 cm = 5.3 cm/s** The direction of velocity **v** is along the tangent to the circle at every point. The acceleration is directed towards the centre of the circle. Since this direction changes continuously, **acceleration here is not a constant vector**. However, the magnitude of acceleration is constant: **a = w² * R = (0.44)² * 12 = 2.3 cm/s²** ## SUMMARY 1. Scalar quantities are quantities with magnitudes only. Examples are distance, speed, mass and temperature. 2. Vector quantities are quantities with magnitude and direction both. Examples are displacement, velocity and acceleration. They obey special rules of vector algebra. 3. A vector A multiplied by a real number lamda is also a vector, whose magnitude is lamda times the magnitude of the vector A and whose direction is the same or opposite depending upon whether lamda is positive or negative. 4. Two vectors A and B may be added graphically using head-to-tail method or parallelogram method. 5. Vector addition is commutative: A + B = B + A It also obeys the associative law: (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) 6. A null or zero vector is a vector with zero magnitude. Since the magnitude is zero, we don’t have to specify its direction. It has the properties: A + 0 = A lamda 0 = 0 0 A = 0 7. The subtraction of vector B from A is defined as the sum of A and –B: A – B = A + (–B) 8. A vector A can be resolved into components along two given vectors a and b lying in the same plane: A = lamda a + mu b where lamda and mu are real numbers. 9. A unit vector associated with a vector A has magnitude 1 and is along the vector A: n_hat = A / magnitude(A) The unit vectors i_hat, j_hat, k_hat are vectors of unit magnitude and point in the direction of the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively in a right-handed coordinate system. 10. A vector A can be expressed as: A = A_x i_hat + A_y j_hat where A_x, A_y are its components along x- and y-axes. If vector A makes an angle theta with the x-axis, then: A_x = A cos(theta), A_y = A sin(theta) magnitude(A) = sqrt(A_x^2 + A_y^2) tan(theta) = A_y / A_x 11. Vectors can be conveniently added using analytical method. If sum of two vectors A and B, that lie in x–y plane, is R, then: R = R_x i_hat + R_y j_hat, where R_x = A_x + B_x, and R_y = A_y + B_y 12. The position vector of an object in x–y plane is given by: r = x i_hat + y j_hat and the displacement from position r to position r′ is given by: Δr = r′ – r = (x′ – x) i_hat + (y′ – y) j_hat = Δx i_hat + Δy j_hat 13. If an object undergoes a displacement Δr in time Δt, its average velocity is given by: v = Δr / Δt The velocity of an object at time t is the limiting value of the average velocity as Δt tends to zero: ------------------------------------------------- Then, Eq.(3.34b) becomes : \\[x=v_{\\alpha}t=\\left(v_{o}\\,\\cos\\,\\theta_{o}\\right)t\\] \\[\\text{and}\\quad\\quad y=\\left(v_{o}\\sin()\\,\\theta_{o}\\right)t-\\left( \\,\\gamma_{2}\\,\\right)g\\,t^{2} \\tag{3.37}\\] The components of velocity at time \\(t\\) can be obtained usin()g Eq.(3.33b) : \\[v_{x}=v_{\\alpha}=v_{o}\\,\\cos\\,\\theta_{o}\\] \\[v_{y}=v_{o}\\,\\sin()\\,\\theta_{o}-g\\,t \\tag{3.38}\\] Equation (3.37) gives the \\(x\\)-, and \\(y\\)-coordinates of the position of a projectile at time \\(t\\) in terms of two parameters -- initial speed \\(v_{o}\\) and projection angle \\(\\theta_{o}\\). Notice that the choice of mutually perpendicular \\(x\\)-, and \\(y\\)-directions for the analysis of the projectile motion has resulted in a simplification. One of the components of velocity, i.e. \\(x\\)-component remains constant throughout the motion and only the \\(y\\)- component changes, like an object in free fall in vertical direction. This is shown graphically at few instants in Fig. 3.17. Note that at the point of maximum height, \\(v_{y}\\)= 0 and therefore,. \\[\\theta=\\tan^{-1}\\frac{v_{y}}{v_{x}}=0\\]",

This is why this acceleration is called **centripetal acceleration** (a term proposed by Newton). A thorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was first published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) but it was probably known to Newton also some years earlier. \"Centripetal\" comes from a Greek term which means 'centre-seeking'. sin()ce \\(v\\) and \\(R\\) are constant, the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also constant. However, the direction changes -- pointing always towards the centre. Therefore, a centripetal acceleration is not a constant vector. We have another way of describing the velocity and the acceleration of an object in uniform circular motion. As the object moves from P to P' in time \\(\\Delta t\\) (= \\(t^{\\prime}-\\theta\\), the line CP (Fig. 3.18) turns through an angle \\(\\Delta\\theta\\) as shown in the figure. \\(\\Delta\\theta\\) is called angular distance. We define the angular speed \\(\\omega\\) (Greek letter omega) as the time rate of change of angular displacement : \\[\\omega=\\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{\\Delta t} \\tag{3.44}\\] Now, if the distance travelled by the object during the time \\(\\Delta t\\) is \\(\\Delta s\\), i.e. \\(PP\\) is \\(\\Delta s\\), then : \\[\\upsilon=\\frac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t}\\] but \\(\\Delta s=R\\Delta\\theta\\). Therefore : \\[\\upsilon=R\\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{\\Delta t}=R\\omega \\tag{3.45}\\] \\[\\upsilon=R\\omega \\tag{3.46}\\] We can express centripetal acceleration \\(a_{c}\\) in terms of angular speed : \\[a_{c}=\\frac{\\upsilon^{2}}{R}=\\frac{\\omega^{2}R^{2}}{R}=\\omega^{2}R \\tag{3.47}\\] \\[\\cdot a_{c}=\\omega^{2}R \\tag{3.48}\\] The time taken by an object to make one revolution is known as its time period \\(T\\) and the number of revolution made in one second is called its frequency \\(\\upsilon\\) (=1/\\(T\\)). However, during this time the distance moved by the object is \\(s=2\\pi R\\). Therefore, \\(\\upsilon=2\\pi R/T\\)=2\\(\\pi R\\upsilon\\) In terms of frequency \\(\\upsilon\\), we have \\[\\omega=2\\pi\\upsilon \\tag{3.49}\\] \\[\\upsilon=2\\pi R\\upsilon\\] (3.50) \\[a_{c}=4\\pi^{2}\\upsilon^{2}R \\tag{3.51}\\] **Example 3.9** An insect trapped in a circular groove of radius 12 cm moves along the groove steadily and completes 7 revolutions in 100 s. (a) What is the angular speed, and the linear speed of the motion? (b) Is the acceleration vector a constant vector? What is its magnitude? **Answer** This is an example of uniform circular motion. Here \\(R=12\\) cm. The angular speed \\(\\omega\\) is given by \\[\\omega=2\\pi/T=2\\pi\\ \\ 7/100=0.44\\ \\mathrm{rad/s}\\] The linear speed \\(\\upsilon\\) is : \\[\\upsilon=\\omega R=0.44\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\ \\ 12\\ \\mathrm{cm}=5.3\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\] The direction of velocity \\(v\\) is along the tangent to the circle at every point. The acceleration is directed towards the centre of the circle. sin()ce this direction changes continuously, acceleration here is _not_ a constant vector. However, the magnitude of acceleration is constant: \\[a=\\omega^{2}R=(0.44\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})^{2}\\ (12\\ \\mathrm{cm})\\] \\[=2.3\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{2}\\] ## Summary 1. _Scalar quantities_ are quantities with magnitudes only. Examples are distance, speed, mass and temperature. 2. _Vector quantities_ are quantities with magnitude and direction both. Examples are displacement, velocity and acceleration. They obey special rules of vector algebra. 3. A vector **A** multiplied by a real number \\(\\lambda\\) is also a vector, whose magnitude is \\(\\lambda\\) times the magnitude of the vector **A** and whose direction is the same or opposite depending upon whether \\(\\lambda\\) is positive or negative. 4. Two vectors **A** and **B** may be _added graphically_ usin()g _head-to-tail method_ or _parallelogram method_. 5. Vector addition is _commutative_ : \\(\\textbf{A}+\\textbf{B}=\\textbf{B}+\\textbf{A}\\) It also obeys the _associative law_ : \\(\\textbf{(A}+\\textbf{B})+\\textbf{C}=\\textbf{A}+\\textbf{(B}+\\textbf{C})\\) 6. A _null_ or _zero vector_ is a vector with zero magnitude. sin()ce the magnitude is zero, we don't have to specify its direction. It has the properties : \\(\\textbf{A}+\\textbf{0}=\\textbf{A}\\) \\(\\lambda\\textbf{0}=\\textbf{0}\\) \\(\\lambda\\textbf{0}=\\textbf{0}\\) \\(\\textbf{A}=\\textbf{0}\\) 7. The _subtraction_ of vector **B** from **A** is defined as the sum of **A** and -**B** : \\(\\textbf{A}-\\textbf{B}=\\textbf{A}+\\textbf{(-B)}\\) 8. A vector **A** can be _resolved_ into component along two given vectors **a** and **b** lying in the same plane : \\(\\textbf{A}=\\lambda\\textbf{a}+\\mu\\textbf{b}\\) where \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\mu\\) are real numbers. 9. A _until vector_ associated with a vector **A** has magnitude 1 and is along the vector **A**: \\(\\textbf{\\hat{n}}=\\textbf{A}\\) The unit vectors \\(\\textbf{\\hat{i}}\\), **j**, \\(\\textbf{\\hat{k}}\\) are vectors of unit magnitude and point in the direction of the \\(x\\). \\(y\\)-, and \\(z\\)-axes, respectively in a right-handed coordinate system. 10. A vector **A** can be expressed as where \\(A_{x}\\), \\(A_{y}\\) are its components along \\(x\\)-, and \\(y\\)-axes. If vector **A** makes an angle \\(\\theta\\) with the \\(x\\)-axis, then \\(A_{x}=A\\cos\\theta_{x}\\Delta_{y}\\textbf{A}\\sin()\\theta\\) and \\(\\textbf{A}=\\textbf{|A|}=\\sqrt{A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}}\\), \\(\\textbf{tan}\\theta=\\frac{A_{y}}{A_{x}}\\). 11. Vectors can be conveniently added usin()g _analytical method_. If sum of two vectors **A** and **B**, that lie in \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane, is **R**, then : \\(\\textbf{R}=\\textbf{R}_{x}\\textbf{\\hat{i}}+\\textbf{R}_{y}\\textbf{\\hat{j}}\\), where, \\(\\textbf{R}_{x}\\textbf{\\hat{n}}=A_{x}+B_{x}\\) and \\(\\textbf{R}_{y}=A_{y}+B_{y}\\) 12. The _position vector_ of an object in \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane is given by \\(\\textbf{r}=x\\textbf{\\hat{i}}+y\\textbf{\\hat{j}}\\) and the _displacement_ from position **r** to position **r** is given by \\(\\textbf{\\alpha}=\\textbf{r}^{\\prime}-\\textbf{r}\\) \\(=(x^{\\prime}-x)\\textbf{\\hat{i}}+(y^{\\prime}-y)\\textbf{\\hat{j}}\\) \\(=\\Delta x\\textbf{\\hat{i}}+\\Delta y\\textbf{\\hat{j}}\\) 13. If an object undergoes a displacement \\(\\Delta\\textbf{r}\\) in time \\(\\Delta t\\), its _average velocity_ is given by \\(\\textbf{v}=\\frac{\\Delta\\textbf{r}}{\\Delta t}\\). The _velocity_ of an object at time \\(t\\) is the limiting value of the average velocity as \\(\\Delta t\\) tends to zero :\\(\\mathbf{v}=\\alpha\\mathbf{\\underline{\\underline{\\mathbf{r}}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{ \\underline{\\mathbf{r}}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}}\\mathbf{ \\underline{\\mathbf{r}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}}\\mathbf{ \\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\mathbf{r}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{ \\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\mathbf{r}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{ \\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\mathbf{r}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{ \\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\mathbf{r}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{ \\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\mathbf{r}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{ \\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\mathbf{r}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{ \\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\mathbf{r}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{ \\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\mathbf{r}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{ \\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{ \\mathbf{r}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{ \\mathbf{d}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\mathbf{r}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\underline{ \\mathbf{d}}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}\\mathbf{\\underline{\\mathbf{d}}}}\\) When position of an object is plotted on a coordinate system, \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is always tangent to the curve representing the path of the object. 14. If the velocity of an object changes from \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{v}\\)'in time \\(\\Delta t\\), then its _average acceleration_ is given by: \\(\\mathbf{\\ \\ \\ \\ }\\mathbf{\\ \\

The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same as the magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points: the path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are equal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all other cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement. 2. In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement. 3. The vector equations (3.33a) and (3.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course, you can always resolve them along any two independent axes. 4. The kinematic equations for uniform acceleration do not apply to the case of uniform circular motion sin()ce in this case the magnitude of acceleration is constant but its direction is changing. 5. An object subjected to two velocities \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) has a resultant velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{v}_{1}+\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\). Take care to distinguish it from velocity of object 1 relative to velocity of object \\(2:\\mathbf{v}_{12}-\\mathbf{v}_{1}-\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\). Here \\(\\mathbf{v}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{2}\\) are velocities with reference to some common reference frame. 6. The resultant acceleration of an object in circular motion is towards the centre only if the speed is constant. 7. The shape of the trajectory of the motion of an object is not determined by the acceleration alone but also depends on the initial conditions of motion ( initial position and initial velocity). For example, the trajectory of an object moving under the same acceleration due to gravity can be a straight line or a parabola depending on the initial conditions. State, for each of the following physical quantities, if it is a scalar or a vector : volume, mass, speed, acceleration, density, number of moles, velocity, angular frequency, displacement, angular velocity. 3.

Pick out the only vector quantity in the following list : Temperature, pressure, impulse, time, power, total path length, energy, gravitational potential, coefficient of friction, charge. 3. State with reasons, whether the following algebraic operations with scalar and vector physical quantities are meaningful : (a) adding any two scalars, (b) adding a scalar to a vector of the same dimensions, (c) multiplying any vector by any scalar, (d) multiplying any two scalars, (e) adding any two vectors, (f) adding a component of a vector to the same vector. 3.

But in order to describe motion of an object in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions (space), we need to use vectors to describe the above-mentioned physical quantities. Therefore, it is first necessary to learn the language of vectors. What is a vector? How to add, subtract and multiply vectors? What is the result of multiplying a vector by a real number? We shall learn this to enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and acceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object in a plane. As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail the projectile motion.

    "question": "Explain the concept of Instantaneous velocity and speed",
    "answer": "The average velocity tells us how fast an object has been moving over a given time interval but does not tell us how fast it moves at different instants of time during that interval. For this, we define **instantaneous velocity** or simply velocity v at an instant t. The velocity at an instant is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval Δ t becomes infinitesimally small. In other words, v = lim Δt tends to0 of (Δx)/(Δt) (Eq. 2.1a) = (dx)/(dt) (Eq. 2.1b) where the symbol lim Δt tends to0 stands for the operation of taking limit as Δt tends to0 of the quantity on its right. In the language of calculus, the quantity on the right hand side of Eq. 2.1a is the differential coefficient of x with respect to t and is denoted by  (dx)/(dt).It is the rate of change of position with respect to time, at that instant. We can use Eq. (2.1a) for obtaining the value of velocity at an instant either **graphically or numerically**. Suppose that we want to obtain graphically the value of velocity at time t = 4 s (point P) for the motion of the car represented in Fig.2.1 calculation. Let us take Δ t = 2 s centred at t = 4 s. Then, by the definition of the average velocity, the slope of line P_1P_2 ( Fig. 2.1) gives the value of average velocity over the interval 3 s to 5 s. Now, we decrease the value of Δt from 2 s to 1 s. Then line P_1P_2 becomes Q_1Q_2 and its slope gives the value of the average velocity over the interval 3.5 s to 4.5 s. In the limit Δt tends to0, the line P_1P_2 becomes tangent to the position-time curve at the point P and the velocity at t = 4 s is given by the slope of the tangent at that point. It is difficult to show this process graphically. But if we use numerical method to obtain the value of the velocity, the meaning of the limiting process becomes clear. For the graph shown in Fig. 2.1, x = 0.08 * t^3. Table 2.1 gives the value of (Δx)/(Δt) calculated for Δt equal to 2.0 s, 1.0 s, 0.5 s, 0.1 s and 0.01 s centred at t = 4.0 s. The second and third columns give the value of t_1 = (t - (Δt/2)) and t_2 = ( t + (Δt/2)) and the fourth and the fifth columns give the corresponding values of x, i.e. x(t_1) = 0.08 * (t_1)^3 and x(t_2) = 0.08 * (t_2)^3. The sixth column lists the difference Δx = x(t_2) - x(t_1) and the last column gives the ratio of Δx and Δt, i.e. the average velocity corresponding to the value of Δt listed in the first column. We see from Table 2.1 that as we decrease the value of Δt from 2.0 s to 0.010 s, the value of the average velocity approaches the limiting value 3.84 m s^(-1) which is the value of velocity at t = 4.0 s, i.e. the value of dx/dt at t = 4.0 s. In this manner, we can calculate velocity at each instant for motion of the car. The graphical method for the determination of the instantaneous velocity is always not a convenient method. For this, we must carefully plot the position-time graph and calculate the value of average velocity as Δt becomes smaller and smaller. It is easier to calculate the value of velocity at different instants if we have data of positions at different instants or exact expression for the position as a function of time. Then, we calculate (Δx)/(Δt) from the data for decreasing the value of Δ t and find the limiting value as we have done in Table 2.1 or use differential calculus for the given expression and calculate dx/dt at different instants as done in the following example. The position of an object moving along x-axis is given by x = a + b * t^3 where a = 8.5 m, b = 2.5 m s^(-2) and t is measured in seconds. What is its velocity at t = 0 s and t = 2.0 s. What is the average velocity between t = 2.0 s and t = 4.0 s? In notation of differential calculus, the velocity is v = dx/dt = d(a + b * t^2)/dt = 2 * b * t = 5.0 * t m s^(-1) At t = 0 s, v = 0 m s^(-1) and at t = 2.0 s, v = 10 m s^(-1). Average velocity = ((x * (4.0)) - (x * (2.0)))/(4.0 - 2.0) = (a + (16 * b) - a - (4 * b))/2.0 = 6.0 * b = 6.0 * 2.5 = 15 m s^(-1) Note that for uniform motion, velocity is the same as the average velocity at all instants. Instantaneous speed or simply speed is the magnitude of velocity. For example, a velocity of + 24.0 m s^(-1) and a velocity of - 24.0 m s^(-1) – both have an associated speed of 24.0 m s^(-1). It should be noted that though average speed over a finite interval of time is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity, instantaneous speed at an instant is equal to the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity at that instant.

    "question": "Explain the concept of Acceleration",
    "answer": "The velocity of an object, in general, changes during its course of motion. How to describe this change? Should it be described as the rate of change in velocity **with distance** or **with time**? This was a problem even in Galileo's time. It was first thought that this change could be described by the rate of change of velocity with distance, But, through his studies of motion of freely falling objects and motion of objects on an inclined plane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change of velocity with time is a constant of motion for all objects in free fall. On the other hand, the change in velocity with distance is not constant - it decreases with the increasing distance of fall. This led to the concept of acceleration as the rate of change of velocity with time. The average acceleration ā over a time interval is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time interval : ā = (v_2 - v_1)/(t_2 - t_1) = (Δv)/(Δt)  (Eq. 2.2) where v_2 and v_1 are the instantaneous velocities or simply velocities at time t_2 and t_1. It is the average change of velocity per unit time. The SI unit of acceleration is m s^(-2). On a plot of velocity versus time, the average acceleration is the slope of the straight line connecting the points corresponding to (v_2,t_2) and (v_1,t_1). Instantaneous acceleration is defined in the same way as the instantaneous velocity : a = lim Δt tends to0 of (Δv)/(Δt) = dv/dt  (Eq. 2.3) The acceleration at an instant is the slope of the tangent to the v - t curve at that instant. Since velocity is a quantity having both magnitude and direction, a change in velocity may involve either or both of these factors. Acceleration, therefore, may result from a change in speed (magnitude), a change in direction or changes in both. Like velocity, acceleration can also be positive, negative or zero. Position-time graphs for motion with positive, negative and zero acceleration are shown in Figs. 4 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. Note that the graph curves upward for positive acceleration; downward for negative acceleration and it is a straight line for zero acceleration. Although acceleration can vary with time, our study in this chapter will be restricted to motion with constant acceleration. In this case, the average acceleration equals the constant value of acceleration during the interval. If the velocity of an object is v_0 at t = 0 and v at time t, we have ā = (v - v_0)/(t - 0) or, v = v_0 + (a * t) (Eq. 2.4) Let us see how velocity-time graph looks like for some simple cases. Fig. 3 shows velocity-time graph for motion with constant acceleration for the following cases : 1. An object is moving in a positive direction with a positive acceleration. 2. An object is moving in positive direction with a negative acceleration. 3. An object is moving in negative direction with a negative acceleration. 4. An object is moving in positive direction till time t_r, and then turns back with the same negative acceleration. An interesting feature of a velocity-time graph for any moving object is that **the area under the curve represents the displacement over a given time interval**. A general proof of this statement requires use of calculus. We can, however, see that it is true for the simple case of an object moving with constant velocity u. Its velocity-time graph is as shown in Fig. 4. The v - t curve is a straight line parallel to the time axis and the area under it between t = 0 and t = T is the area of the rectangle of height u and base T. Therefore, area = u * T which is the displacement in this time interval. How come in this case an area is equal to a distance? Think! Note the dimensions of quantities on the two coordinate axes, and you will arrive at the answer. **Note that the x - t, v - t, and a - t graphs shown in several figures in this chapter have sharp kinks at some points implying that the functions are not differentiable at these points. In any realistic situation, the functions will be differentiable at all points and the graphs will be smooth**. **What this means physically is that acceleration and velocity cannot change values abruptly at an instant. Changes are always continuous.**",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Kinematic equations for uniformly accelerated motion",
    "answer": "For uniformly accelerated motion, we can derive some simple equations that relate displacement (x), time taken (t), initial velocity (v_0), final velocity (v) and acceleration (a). Equation (2.4) already obtained gives a relation between final and initial velocities v and v_0 of an object moving with uniform acceleration a: v = v_0 + (a * t)  (Eq. 2.4) This relation is graphically represented in Fig. 2.5. The area under this curve is : Area between instants 0 and t = Area of triangle ABC + Area of rectangle OACD = 1/2(v - v_0) * t + (v_0 * t) As explained in the previous section, the area under v - t curve represents the displacement. Therefore, the displacement x of the object is : x = 1/2 * ((v-v_0) * t) + (v_0 * t) (Eq. 2.5) But v - v_0 = a * t Therefore, x = (1/2) * a * (t^2) + (v_0 * t) or, x = (v_0 * t) + (1/2) * a * (t^2)  (Eq. 2.6) Equation (2.5) can also be written as x = v + (v_0/(2 * t)) = v_bar * t (Eq. 2.7a) where,  v_bar = (v + v_0)/2 (constant acceleration only) Equations (2.7a) and (2.7b) mean that the object has undergone displacement x with an average velocity equal to the arithmetic average of the initial and final velocities. From Eq. (2.4), t = (v-v_0)/a. Substituting this in Eq. (2.7a), we get x = v_bar * t = ((v + v_0)/2) * ((v - v_0)/a)=(v^2 - v_0 ^ 2)/(2 * a) v^2 = (v_0^2) + (2 * a * x)  (Eq. 2.8) Figure 2.4: Area under v - t curve equals displacement of the object over a given time interval. Figure 2.5: Area under v - t curve for an object with uniform acceleration. This equation can also be obtained by substituting the value of t from Eq. (2.4) into Eq. (2.6). Thus, we have obtained three important equations : v = v_0 + (a * t) x = (v_0 * t) + ((1/2) * a * (t^2)) v^2 = (v_0^2) + (2 * a * x)  (Eq. 2.9a) connecting five quantities v_0,v,a,t and x.These are kinematic equations of rectilinear motion for constant acceleration. The  set  of  Eq.  (2.9a)  were  obtained  by assuming that at t = 0, the position of the particle,x is 0.  We can obtain a more general equation if we take  the  position coordinate at t = 0 as non-zero,  say  x0.    Then  Eqs.  (2.9a)  are  modified (replacing x by x – x0 ) to : v = v_0 + (a * t) x = x_0 + (v_0 * t) + ((1/2) * a * (t^2)) v^2 = (v_0^2) + (2 * a * (x - x_0)) **Example 2.2**: Obtain equations of motion for constant acceleration using method of calculus. **Answer**:  By definition, a = dv/dt Integrating on both sides, integrate 1 dv from v_0 to v = integrate a dt from 0 to t = a * (integrate 1 dt from 0 to t) (a is constant) v - v_0 = a * t v = v_0 + (a * t) Further, v = dx/dt dx = v dt Integrating on both sides, integrate 1 dx from x_0 to x = integrate v dt from 0 to t = integrate (v_0 + (a * t)) dt from 0 to t x - x_0 = (v_0 * t) + ((1/2) * a * (t^2)) We can write a = dv/dt = (dv/dx) * (dx/dt) = v * (dv/dx) or v dv = a dx Integrating on both sides, integrate v dv from v_0 to v = integrate a dx from x_0 to x ((v^2) - (v_0^2))/2 = a * (x - x_0) v^2 = (v_0^2) + (2 * a * (x - x_0)) The advantage of this method is that it can be used for  motion  with  non-uniformacceleration also. **Example 2.3**: A  ball  is  thrown  vertically upwards with a velocity of 20 m s^(–1) from the  top  of  a  multistorey  building.  The height of the point from where the ball is thrown is 25.0 m from the ground. (a) How high will the ball rise ?  and (b) how long will it be before the ball hits the ground? Take g = 10 m s^(–2). **Answer**:    (a)  Let  us  take  the  y-axis  in  the vertically  upward  direction  with  zero  at  the ground, as shown in Fig. 2.6. Now  v_0 = 20 m s^(–1),a  =  – g = –10 m s^(–2),v  =  0 m s^(–1) If  the  ball  rises  to  height  y  from  the  point  of launch, then using the equation v^2 = (v_0^2) + (2 * a * (y - y_0)) we get 0 = (20)^2 + (2 * (–10) * (y – y0)).Solving,  we get, (y – y0) = 20 m. (b) We can solve this part of the problem in two ways. **FIRST METHOD** : In the first method, we split the path in two parts : the upward motion (A to B) and the downward motion (B to C) and calculate the corresponding time taken t_1 and t_2. Since the velocity at B is zero, we have : v = v_0 + (a * t);0 = 20 - (10 * t_1);t_1 = 2 s Or,This is the time in going from A to B. From B, or the point of the maximum height, the ball falls freely under the acceleration due to gravity. The ball is moving in negative y direction. We use equation y = y_0 + (v_0 * t) + ((1/2) * a * (t^2)) We have,y_0 = 45 m,y = 0,v_0 = 0,a = -g = 10 m s^(-2);0 = 45 +((1/2) * (–10) * (t_2^2)) Solving, we get t_2 = 3 s.Therefore, the total time taken by the ball before it hits the ground = t_1 + t_2 = 2 s + 3 s = 5 s. **SECOND METHOD** : The total time taken can also be calculated by noting the coordinates of initial and final positions of the ball with respect to the origin chosen and using equation y = y_0 + (v_0 * t) + ((1/2) * a * (t^2)).Now y_0 = 25 m;y = 0 m;v_0 = 20 m s^(-1);a = -10 m s^(-2);t = ? 0 = 25 + (20 * t) + ((1/2) * (–10) * (t^2));0 = 45 + ((1/2) *  (–10) * (t^2)) Or (5 * (t^2)) - (20 * t) - 25 = 0.Solving this quadratic equation for t, we get t = 5s Note that the second method is better since we do not have to worry about the path of the motion as the motion is under constant acceleration. **Example  2.4**:  Free-fall:Discuss  the motion of an object under free  fall.Neglect air resistance. **Answer**:  An object released near the surface of the Earth is accelerated downward under the influence of the force of gravity. The magnitude of acceleration due to gravity is represented by g.  If air resistance is neglected, the object is said  to  be  in  free  fall.  If  the  height  through which the object falls is small compared to the earth’s radius, g can be taken to be constant, equal to   9.8 m s^(–2). Free fall is thus a case of motion with uniform acceleration.We assume that the motion is in y-direction,more  correctly  in  –y direction  because  we choose upward direction as positive. Since the acceleration due to gravity is always downward,it is in the negative direction and we have a = – g  = – 9.8 m s^(–2).The object is released from rest at y = 0. Therefore,v_0 = 0 and the equations of motion become: v =  0 – (g * t) = (–9.8 * t) m s^(–1) y =  0 – ((1/2) * g * (t^2)) = (–4.9 * (t^2)) m v^2 = 0 – (2 * g *  y) = (–19.6 * y)   m^2 s^(–2) These  equations  give  the  velocity  and  the distance travelled as a function of time and also the  variation  of  velocity  with  distance. **Example  2.5 Galileo’s  law  of  odd numbers**: “The distances traversed, during equal intervals  of time, by a body falling from rest, stand to one another in the same ratio as the odd numbers beginning with unity [namely, 1: 3: 5: 7......].”  Prove it. **Answer**:  Let us divide the time interval of motion of an object under free fall into many equal intervals τ   and find out the distances traversed  during  successive  intervals  of time. Since initial velocity is zero, we have y = ((-1/2) * g * (t^2)) Using  this  equation,we can calculate the position  of  the  object  after  different  time intervals 0,τ,2τ,3τ... which are given in second column of Table  2.2.If we take ((–1/2) * g * (τ^2)) as y0;the position coordinate after first time interval τ, then third column gives the positions in the unit of y_0.The fourth column gives the distances traversed in successive τs. We find that the distances are in the simple ratio 1: 3: 5: 7: 9: 11... as  shown in the last column. This  law was established by Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) who was the first to make quantitative studies of free fall. **Example  2.6    Stopping  distance  of vehicles**: When brakes are applied to a moving vehicle, the distance it travels before stopping is called stopping distance.It is an important factor for road safety and depends on the initial velocity (v_0) and the braking capacity, or deceleration, –a that is  caused  by  the  braking.  Derive  an expression for stopping distance of a vehicle in terms of v_0 and a. **Answer**:  Let the distance travelled by the vehicle before it stops be ds.Then,using equation of motion  v^2 = (v_0^2) + (2 * a * x),and noting that v = 0,we have the stopping distance d_s = (-v_0^2)/(2 * a).Thus, the stopping distance is proportional to the square of the initial velocity.Doubling the initial velocity increases the stopping distance by a factor of 4 (for the same deceleration).For  the car of a particular make, the braking distance was found to be 10 m, 20 m, 34 m and 50 m corresponding to velocities of 11, 15, 20 and 25 m/s which are nearly consistent with the above formula.Stopping distance is an important factor considered in setting speed limits,for example,in school zones. **Example 2.7  Reaction time**: When a situation demands our immediate action,it takes some time before we really respond.Reaction time is the time a person takes to observe,think and act.For example,if a person is driving and suddenly a boy appears on the road, then the time elapsed before he slams the brakes of the car is the reaction time.Reaction time depends on complexity of the situation and on an individual.You can measure your reaction time by a simple experiment.Take a ruler and ask your friend to drop it vertically through the gap between your thumb and forefinger.After you catch it, find the distance d travelled by the ruler.In a particular case,d was found to be 21.0 cm.Estimate reaction time. **Answer**: The ruler drops under free fall.Therefore, v_0 = 0, and a = – g = –9.8 m s^(–2).The distance travelled d and the reaction time t_r are related by d = ((-1/2) * g * (t_r^2)) Or, t_r = sqrt((2 * d)/g) s.Given d = 21.0 cm and g = 9.8 m s^(–2) the reaction time is t_r = sqrt((2 * 0.21)/9.8) s = 0.2 s (approx.) ## Summary * An object is said to be in motion if its position changes with time.The position of the object can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin.For motion in a straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as negative.The average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. * Instantaneous velocity or simply velocity is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval ∆t becomes infinitesimally small: v = lim ∆t tends to0 of v_bar = lim ∆t tends to0 of (∆x/∆t) = (dx/dt).The velocity at a particular instant is equal to the slope of the tangent drawn on position-time graph at that instant. * Average acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time interval during which the change occurs: ā = (∆v/∆t) * Instantaneous acceleration is defined as the limit of the average acceleration as the time interval ∆t goes to zero: a = lim ∆t tends to0 of ā = lim ∆t tends to0 of (∆v/∆t) = (dv/dt).The acceleration of an object at a particular time is the slope of the velocity-time graph at that instant of time.For uniform motion,acceleration is zero and the x - t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis and the v - t graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis.For motion with uniform acceleration,x - t graph is a parabola while the v - t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis. * The area under the velocity-time curve between times t1 and t2 is equal to the displacement of the object during that interval of time. * For objects in uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion, the five quantities, displacement x, time taken t, initial velocity v0, final velocity v and acceleration a are related by a set of simple equations called kinematic equations of motion: v = v_0 + (a * t);x = (v_0 * t) + ((1/2) * a * (t^2));v^2 = (v_0^2) + (2 * a * x).if the position of the object at time t = 0 is 0.If the particle starts at x = x_0,x in above equations is replaced by (x – x_0).",

We see leaves falling from trees and water flowing down a dam. Automobiles and planes carry people from one place to the other. The earth rotates once every twenty-four hours and revolves round the sun once in a year. The sun itself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving within its local group of galaxies. Motion is change in position of an object with time. How does the position change with time? In this chapter, we shall learn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the concepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight line, also known as **rectilinear motion**. For the case of rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple equations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity. In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as point objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a reasonable duration of time. In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error. In **Kinematics**, we study ways to describe motion without going into the causes of motion.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Aristotle's Fallacy",
    "answer": "The question posed above appears to be simple. However, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the correct answer to this question given by Galileo in the seventeenth century was the foundation of Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the birth of modern science. The Greek thinker, Aristotle (384 B.C- 322 B.C.), held the view that if a body is moving, something external is required to keep it moving. According to this view, for example, an arrow shot from a bow keeps flying since the air behind the arrow keeps pushing it. The view was part of an elaborate framework of ideas developed by Aristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe. Most of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now known to be wrong and need not concern us. For our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of motion may be phrased thus: **An external force is required to keep a body in motion**. Aristotelian law of motion is flawed, as we shall see. However, it is a natural view that anyone would hold from common experience. Even a small child playing with a simple (non-electric) toy-car on a floor knows intuitively that it needs to constantly drag the string attached to the toy-car with some force to keep it going. If it releases the string, it comes to rest. This experience is common to most terrestrial motion. External forces seem to be needed to keep bodies in motion. Left to themselves, all bodies eventually come to rest. What is the flaw in Aristotle's argument? The answer is: a moving toy car comes to rest because the external force of friction on the car by the floor opposes its motion. To counter this force, the child has to apply an external force on the car in the direction of motion. When the car is in uniform motion, there is no net external force acting on it: the force by the child cancels the force ( friction) by the floor. The corollary is: if there were no friction, the child would not be required to apply any force to keep the toy car in uniform motion. The opposing forces such as friction (solids) and viscous forces (for fluids) are always present in the natural world. This explains why forces by external agencies are necessary to overcome the frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform motion. Now we understand where Aristotle went wrong. He coded this practical experience in the form of a basic argument. To get at the true law of nature for forces and motion, one has to imagine a world in which uniform motion is possible with no frictional forces opposing. This is what Galileo did.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of The Law of Inertia",
    "answer": "Galileo studied motion of objects on an inclined plane. Objects (i) moving down an inclined plane accelerate, while those (ii) moving up retard. (iii) Motion on a horizontal plane is an intermediate situation. Galileo concluded that an object moving on a frictionless horizontal plane must neither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it should move with constant velocity (Fig. 4.1(a)). Another experiment by Galileo leading to the same conclusion involves a double inclined plane. A ball released from rest on one of the planes rolls down and climbs up the other. If the planes are smooth, the final height of the ball is nearly the same as the initial height (a little less but never greater). In the ideal situation, when friction is absent, the final height of the ball is the same as its initial height. If the slope of the second plane is decreased and the experiment repeated, the ball will still reach the same height, but in doing so, it will travel a longer distance. In the limiting case, when the slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a horizontal) the ball travels an infinite distance. In other words, its motion never ceases. This is, of course, an idealised situation (Fig. 4.1(b)). In practice, the ball does come to a stop after moving a finite distance on the horizontal plane, because of the opposing force of friction which can never be totally eliminated. However, if there were no friction, the ball would continue to move with a constant velocity on the horizontal plane. Galileo thus, arrived at a new insight on motion that had eluded Aristotle and those who followed him. The state of rest and the state of uniform linear motion (motion with constant velocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is no net force acting on the body. It is incorrect to assume that a net force is needed to keep a body in uniform motion. To maintain a body in uniform motion, we need to apply an external force to ecounter the frictional force, so that the two forces sum up to zero net external force. To summarise, if the net external force is zero, a body at rest continues to remain at rest and a body in motion continues to move with a uniform velocity. This property of the body is called inertia. Inertia means **‘resistance to change’**. A body does not change its state of rest or uniform motion, unless an external force compels it to change that state.",

  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of Ideas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science",
    "answer": "Ancient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force, the cause of motion, was thought to be of different kinds : force due to continuous pressure (nodan), as the force of wind on a sailing vessel; impact (abhighat), as when a potter's rod strikes the wheel; persistent tendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body; transmitted force by a string, rod, etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps comes closest to the concept of inertia. Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to be opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air resistance. It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational and vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent particles. A falling leaf in the wind may have downward motion as a whole (patail) and also rotational and vibrational motion (bhraman, spandan), but each particle of the leaf at an instant only has a definite (small) displacement. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of motion and units of length and time. It was known that the position of a particle in space can be indicated by distance measured along three axes. Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept of 'instantaneous motion' (_tatkalikat gat_), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous velocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly understood; a current is a motion of particles of water under gravity and fluidity while a wave results from the transmission of vibrations of water particles. The state of rest or uniform linear motion both assume that a net force is needed to keep a body in uniform motion. To maintain a body in uniform motion, we need to apply an external force to ecounter the frictional force, so that the two forces sum up to zero net external force. The state of rest or uniform linear motion both imply zero acceleration. The first law of motion can, therefore, be simply expressed as: **If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero. Acceleration can be non zero only if there is a net external force on the body.** Two kinds of situations are encountered in the application of this law in practice. In some examples, we know that the net external force on the object is zero. In that case we can conclude that the acceleration of the object is zero. For example, a spaceship out in interstellar space, far from all other objects and with all its rockets turned off, has no net external force acting on it. Its acceleration, according to the first law, must be zero. If it is in motion, it must continue to move with a uniform velocity. More often, however, we do not know all the forces to begin with. In that case, if we know that an object is unaccelerated (i.e. it is either at rest or in uniform linear motion), we can infer from the first law that the net external force on the object must be zero. Gravity is everywhere. For terrestrial phenomena, in particular, every object experiences gravitational force due to the earth. Also objects in motion generally experience friction, viscous drag, etc. If then, on earth, an object is at rest or in uniform linear motion, it is not because there are no forces acting on it, but because the various external forces cancel out i.e. add up to zero net external force. Consider a book at rest on a horizontal surface (Fig. 4.2(a)). It is subject to two external forces: the force due to gravity (i.e. its weight *W*) acting downward and the upward force on the book by the table, the normal force *R*. *R* is a self-adjusting force. This is an example of the kind of situation mentioned above. The forces are not quite known fully but the state of motion is known. We observe the book to be at rest. Therefore, we conclude from the first law that the magnitude of *R* equals that of *W*. A statement often encountered is: “Since *W = R*, forces cancel and, therefore, the book is at rest”. This is incorrect reasoning. The correct statement is: “Since the book is observed to be at rest, the net external force on it must be zero, according to the first law. This implies that the normal force *R* must be equal and opposite to the weight *W*”. **Fig. 4.2** **(a)** a book at rest on the table, and **(b)** a car moving with uniform velocity. The net force is zero in each case. Consider the motion of a car starting from rest, picking up speed and then moving on a smooth straight road with uniform speed (Fig. 4.2(b)). When the car is stationary, there is no net force acting on it. During pick-up, it accelerates. This must happen due to a net external force. Note, it has to be an external force. The acceleration of the car cannot be accounted for by any internal force. This might sound surprising, but it is true. The only conceivable external force along the road is the force of friction. It is the frictional force that accelerates the car as a whole. (You will learn about friction in section 4.9). When the car moves with constant velocity, there is no net external force. The property of inertia contained in the First law is evident in many situations. Suppose we are standing in a stationary bus and the driver starts the bus suddenly. We get thrown backward with a jerk. Why? Our feet are in touch with the floor. If there were no friction, we would remain where we were, while the floor of the bus would simply slip forward under our feet and the back of the bus would hit us. However, fortunately, there is some friction between the feet and the floor. If the start is not too sudden, i.e. if the acceleration is moderate, the frictional force would be enough to accelerate our feet along with the bus. But our body is not strictly a rigid body. It is deformable, i.e. it allows some relative displacement between different parts. What this means is that while our feet go with the bus, the rest of the body remains where it is due to inertia. Relative to the bus, therefore, we are thrown backward. As soon as that happens, however, the muscular forces on the rest of the body (by the feet) come into play to move the body along with the bus. A similar thing happens when the bus suddenly stops. Our feet stop due to the friction which does not allow relative motion between the feet and the floor of the bus. But the rest of the body continues to move forward due to inertia. We are thrown forward. The restoring muscular forces again come into play and bring the body to rest. **Example 4.1** An astronaut accidentally gets separated out of his small spaceship accelerating in inter stellar space at a constant rate of 100 m s^-2^. What is the acceleration of the astronaut the instant after he is outside the spaceship? (Assume that there are no nearby stars to exert gravitational force on him.) **Answer** Since there are no nearby stars to exert gravitational force on him and the small spaceship exerts negligible gravitational attraction on him, the net force acting on the astronaut, once he is out of the spaceship, is zero. By the first law of motion the acceleration of the astronaut is zero.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Momentum",
    "answer": "Momentum of a body is defined to be the product of its mass *m* and velocity *v*, and is denoted by *p*: **p = m * v**  (4.1) Momentum is clearly a vector quantity. The following common experiences indicate the importance of this quantity for considering the effect of force on motion. - Suppose a light-weight vehicle (say a small car) and a heavy weight vehicle (say a loaded truck) are parked on a horizontal road. We all know that a much greater force is needed to push the truck than the car to bring them to the same speed in same time. Similarly, a greater opposing force is needed to stop a heavy body than a light body in the same time, if they are moving with the same speed. - If two stones, one light and the other heavy, are dropped from the top of a building, a person on the ground will find it easier to catch the light stone than the heavy stone. The **mass of a body is thus an important parameter** that determines the effect of force on its motion. - Speed is another important parameter to consider. A bullet fired by a gun can easily pierce human tissue before it stops, resulting in casualty. The same bullet fired with moderate speed will not cause much damage. Thus for a given mass, the greater the speed, the greater is the opposing force needed to stop the body in a certain time. Taken together, the product of mass and velocity, that is momentum, is evidently a relevant variable of motion. The greater the change in the momentum in a given time, the greater is the force that needs to be applied. - A seasoned cricketer catches a cricket ball coming in with great speed far more easily than a novice, who can hurt his hands in the act. One reason is that the cricketer allows a longer time for his hands to stop the ball. As you may have noticed, he draws in the hands backward in the act of catching the ball (Fig. 4.3). The novice, on the other hand, keeps his hands fixed and tries to catch the ball almost instantly. He needs to provide a much greater force to stop the ball instantly, and this hurts. The conclusion is clear: force not only depends on the change in momentum, but also on how fast the change is brought about. The same change in momentum brought about in a shorter time needs a greater applied force. In short, the greater the rate of change of momentum, the greater is the force. **Fig. 4.3** *Force not only depends on the change in momentum but also on how fast the change is brought about. A seasoned cricketer draws in his hands during a catch, allowing greater time for the ball to stop and hence requires a smaller force.* - Observations confirm that the product of mass and velocity (i.e. momentum) is basic to the effect of force on motion. Suppose a fixed force is applied for a certain interval of time on two bodies of different masses, initially at rest, the lighter body picks up a greater speed than the heavier body. However, at the end of the time interval, observations show that each body acquires the same momentum. **Thus the same force for the same time causes the same change in momentum for different bodies.** This is a crucial clue to the second law of motion. - In the preceding observations, the vector character of momentum has not been evident. In the examples so far, momentum and change in momentum both have the same direction. But this is not always the case. Suppose a stone is rotated with uniform speed in a horizontal plane by means of a string, the magnitude of momentum is fixed, but its direction changes (Fig. 4.4). A force is needed to cause this change in momentum vector. This force is provided by our hand through the string. Experience suggests that our hand needs to exert a greater force if the stone is rotated at greater speed or in a circle of smaller radius, or both. This corresponds to greater acceleration or equivalently a greater rate of change in momentum vector. This suggests that the greater the rate of change in momentum vector the greater is the force applied. **Fig. 4.4** *Force is necessary for changing the direction of momentum, even if its magnitude is constant. We can feel this while rotating a stone in a horizontal circle with uniform speed by means of a string.* **The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts.** Thus, if under the action of a force *F** for time interval Δt, the velocity of a body of mass m changes from v to **v** + Δ**v** i.e. its initial momentum p = m **v** changes by Δp = mΔv . According to the Second Law, **F = k * (Δp / Δt)**  or  **F = k * (Δp / Δt)** where *k* is a constant of proportionality. Taking the limit Δt tends to0, the term **Δp / Δt** becomes the derivative or differential co-efficient of *p* with respect to *t*, denoted by *dp/dt*. Thus, **F = k * (dp/dt)**  (4.2) For a body of fixed mass *m*, **dp/dt = d/dt (m * v) = m * dv/dt = m * a**  (4.3) i.e. the Second Law can also be written as **F = k * m * a**  (4.4) which shows that force is proportional to the product of mass *m* and acceleration *a*. The unit of force has not been defined so far. In fact, we use Eq. (4.4) to define the unit of force. We, therefore, have the liberty to choose any constant value for *k*. For simplicity, we choose *k = 1*. The second law then is **F = dp/dt = m * a**  (4.5) In SI unit, force is one that causes an acceleration of 1 m/s^2^ to a mass of 1 kg. This unit is known as **newton**: **1 N = 1 kg * m/s^2^** Let us note at this stage some important points about the second law: 1. In the second law, **F = 0** implies **a = 0**. The second law is obviously consistent with the first law. 2. The second law of motion is a vector law. It is equivalent to three equations, one for each component of the vectors: **Fₓ = dpₓ/dt = m * aₓ** **Fᵧ = dpᵧ/dt = m * aᵧ** **F𝓏 = dp𝓏/dt = m * a𝓏**  (4.6) This means that if a force is not parallel to the velocity of the body, but makes some angle with it, it changes only the component of velocity along the direction of force. The component of velocity normal to the force remains unchanged. For example, in the motion of a projectile under the vertical gravitational force, the horizontal component of velocity remains unchanged (Fig. 4.5). ----------------------------------------------------",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Newton's Second Law of Motion",
    "answer": "3. The second law of motion given by Eq. (4.5) is applicable to a single point particle. The force **F** in the law stands for the net external force on the particle and **a** stands for acceleration of the particle. It turns out, however, that the law in the same form applies to a rigid body or, even more generally, to a system of particles. In that case, **F** refers to the total external force on the system and **a** refers to the acceleration of the system as a whole. More precisely, **a** is the acceleration of the centre of mass of the system about which we shall study in detail in Chapter 6. Any internal forces in the system are not to be included in **F**. **Fig. 4.5** *Acceleration at an instant is determined by the force at that instant. The moment after a stone is dropped out of an accelerated train, it has no horizontal acceleration or force, if air resistance is neglected. The stone carries no memory of its acceleration with the train a moment ago.* 4. The second law of motion is a local relation, which means that force **F** at a point in space (location of the particle) at a certain instant of time is related to **a** at that point at that instant. **Acceleration here and now** is determined by the force here and now, not by any history of the motion of the particle (See Fig. 4.5). > **Example 4.2** > A bullet of mass 0.04 kg moving with a speed of 90 m s^-1^ enters a heavy wooden block and is stopped after a distance of 60 cm. What is the average resistive force exerted by the block on the bullet? **Answer** The retardation *a* of the bullet (assumed constant) is given by: **a = -u^2 / (2 * s) = -90 * 90 / (2 * 0.6) = -6750 m/s^2** The retarding force, by the second law of motion, is: **F = 0.04 * 6750 = 270 N** The actual resistive force, and therefore, retardation of the bullet may not be uniform. The answer therefore, only indicates the average resistive force. > **Example 4.3** > The motion of a particle of mass *m* is described by *y = u * t + (1/2) * g * t^2*. Find the force acting on the particle. **Answer** We know: **y = u * t + (1/2) * g * t^2** Now, **v = dy/dt = u + g * t** **a = dv/dt = g** Then the force is given by Eq.

    "question": "Explain the concept of CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM",
    "answer": "The second and third laws of motion lead to an important consequence: the law of conservation of momentum. Take a familiar example. A bullet is fired from a gun. If the force on the bullet by the gun is *F*, the force on the gun by the bullet is *-F*, according to the third law. The two forces act for a common interval of time Δt. According to the second law, *F* Δt is the change in momentum of the bullet and *-F* Δt is the change in momentum of the gun. Since initially, both are at rest, the change in momentum equals the final momentum for each. Thus if *p_b* is the momentum of the bullet after firing and *p_g* is the recoil momentum of the gun, *p_b + p_g = 0*. That is, the total momentum of the bullet + gun system is conserved. Thus in an isolated (i.e. a system with no external force), mutual forces between pairs of particles in the system can cause momentum change in individual particles, but since the mutual forces for each pair are equal and opposite, the momentum changes cancel in pairs and the total momentum remains unchanged. This fact is known as the law of conservation of momentum. The Total Momentum of an Isolated System of Interacting Particles is Conserved An important example of the application of the law of conservation of momentum is the collision of two bodies. Consider two bodies A and B, with initial momenta *p_A* and *p_B*. The bodies collide, get apart, with final momenta *p'_A* and *p'_B* respectively. By the Second Law *F_{AB} Δt = p'_A - p_A* and *F_{BA} Δt = p'_B - p_B* (where we have taken a common interval of time for both forces i.e. the time for which the two bodies are in contact.) Since *F_{AB} = -F_{BA}* by the third law, *p'_A - p_A = -(p'_B - p_B)* i.e. *p'_A + p'_B = p_A + p_B* which shows that the total final momentum of the isolated system equals its initial momentum. Notice that this is true whether the collision is elastic or inelastic. In elastic collisions, there is a second condition that the total initial kinetic energy of the system equals the total final kinetic energy (See Chapter 5).",

    "question": "Explain the concept of COMMON FORCES IN MECHANICS",
    "answer": "In mechanics, we encounter several kinds of forces. The gravitational force is, of course, pervasive. Every object on earth experiences the force of gravity due to the earth. Gravity also governs the motion of celestial bodies. The gravitational force can act at a distance without the need of any intervening medium. All the other forces common in mechanics are contact forces*. As the name suggests, a contact force on an object arises due to contact with some other object: solid or fluid. When bodies are in contact [e.g. a book resting on a table, a system of rigid bodies connected by rods, hinges and ## Other types of supports, there are mutual contact forces (for each pair of bodies) satisfying the third law. The component of contact force normal to the surfaces in contact is called normal reaction. The component parallel to the surfaces in contact is called friction. Contact forces arise also when solids are in contact with fluids. For example, for a solid immersed in a fluid, there is an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. The viscous force, air resistance, etc are also examples of contact forces (Fig. 4.9). Two other common forces are tension in a string and the force due to spring. When a spring is compressed or extended by an external force, a restoring force is generated. This force is usually proportional to the compression or extension (for small displacements). The spring force F is written as F = -k * x where x is the displacement and k is the force constant. The negative sign denotes that the force is opposite to the displacement from the unstretched state. For an inextensible string, the force constant is very high. The restoring force in a string is called tension. It is customary to use a constant tension T throughout the string. This assumption is true for a string of negligible mass. We learnt that there are four fundamental forces in nature. Of these, the weak and strong forces appear in domains that do not concern us here. Only the gravitational and electrical forces are relevant in the context of mechanics. The different contact forces of mechanics mentioned above fundamentally arise from electrical forces. This may seem surprising ## Since we are talking of uncharged and non-magnetic bodies in mechanics. At the microscopic level, all bodies are made of charged constituents (nuclei and electrons) and the various contact forces arising due to elasticity of bodies, molecular collisions and impacts, etc. can ultimately be traced to the electrical forces between the charged constituents of different bodies. The detailed microscopic origin of these forces is, however, complex and not useful for handling problems in mechanics at the macroscopic scale. This is why they are treated as different types of forces with their characteristic properties determined empirically.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Friction",
    "answer": "Let us return to the example of a body of mass m at rest on a horizontal table. The force of gravity (mg) is cancelled by the normal reaction force (R) of the table. Now suppose a force F is applied horizontally to the body. We know from experience that a small applied force may not be enough to move the body. But if the applied force F were the only external force on the body, it must move with acceleration F/m, however small. Clearly, the body remains at rest because some other force comes into play in the horizontal direction and opposes the applied force F, resulting in zero net force on the body. This force f, parallel to the surface of the body in contact with the table is known as frictional force, or simply friction (Fig. 4.10(a)). The subscript stands for static friction to distinguish it from kinetic friction f_k, that we consider later (Fig. 4.10(b)). Note that static friction does not **Fig. 4.10** (a) Static and sliding friction: (a) Impeding motion of the body is opposed by static friction. When external force exceeds the maximum limit of static friction, the body begins to move. (b) Once the body is in motion, its subject to sliding or kinetic friction which opposes relative motion between the two surfaces in contact. Kinetic friction is usually less than the maximum value of static friction. ## Exist by itself. When there is no applied force, there is no static friction. It comes into play the moment there is an applied force. As the applied force F increases, f_s also increases, remaining equal and opposite to the applied force (up to a certain limit), keeping the body at rest. Hence, it is called static friction. Static friction opposes impending motion. The term impending motion means motion that would take place (but does not actually take place) under the applied force, if friction were absent. We know from experience that as the applied force exceeds a certain limit, the body begins to move. It is found experimentally that the limiting value of static friction (f_s)_max is independent of the area of contact and varies with the normal force(N) approximately as: (f_s)_max = mu_s * N where mu_s is a constant of proportionality depending only on the nature of the surfaces in contact. The constant mu_s is called the coefficient of static friction. The law of static friction may thus be written as f_s ≤ (f_s)_max If the applied force F exceeds (f_s)_max, the body begins to slide on the surface. It is found experimentally that when relative motion has started, the frictional force decreases from the static maximum value (f_s)_max. Frictional force that opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact is called kinetic or sliding friction and is denoted by f_k. Kinetic friction, like static friction, is found to be independent of the area of contact. Further, it is nearly independent of the velocity. It satisfies a law similar to that for static friction: f_k = mu_k * N where mu_k, the coefficient of kinetic friction, depends only on the surfaces in contact. As mentioned above, experiments show that mu_k is less than mu_s. When relative motion has begun, the acceleration of the body according to the second law is (F - f_k)/m. For a body moving with constant velocity, F = f_k. If the applied force on the body is removed, its acceleration is -f_k/m and it eventually comes to a stop. The laws of friction given above do not have the status of fundamental laws like those for gravitational, electric and magnetic forces. They are empirical relations that are only approximately true. Yet they are very useful in practical calculations in mechanics. Thus, when two bodies are in contact, each experiences a contact force by the other. Friction, by definition, is the component of the contact force parallel to the surfaces in contact, which opposes impending or actual relative motion between the two surfaces. Note that it is not motion, but relative motion that the frictional force opposes. Consider a box lying in the compartment of a train that is accelerating. If the box is stationary relative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along with the train. What forces cause the acceleration of the box? Clearly, the only conceivable force in the horizontal direction is the force of friction. If there were no friction, the floor of the train would slip by and the box would remain at its initial place due to inertia (and hit the back side of the train). This impending relative motion is opposed by the static friction f_s. Static friction provides the same acceleration to the box as that of the train, keeping it stationary relative to the train.",

    "answer": "**Fig. 4.12** (a) ## Answer As the string is inextensible, and the pulley is smooth, the 3 kg block and the 20 kg trolley both have same magnitude of acceleration. Applying second law to motion of the block (Fig. 4.12(b)), 30 - T = 3a Apply the second law to motion of the trolley (Fig. 4.12(c)), T - f_k = 20 a. Now f_k = mu_k * N, Here mu_k = 0.04, N = 20 * 10 = 200 N. Thus the equation for the motion of the trolley is T - 0.04 * 200 = 20 a Or T - 8 = 20a.

At every instant, there is just one point of contact between the body and the plane and this point has no motion relative to the plane. In this ideal situation, kinetic or static friction is zero and the body should continue to roll with constant velocity. We know, in practice, this will not happen and some resistance to motion (rolling friction) does occur, i.e. to keep the body rolling, some applied force is needed. For the same weight, rolling friction is much smaller (even by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude) than static or sliding friction. This >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> ## Is the reason why discovery of the wheel has been a major milestone in human history. Rolling friction again has a complex origin, though somewhat different from that of static and sliding friction. During rolling, the surfaces in contact get momentarily deformed a little, and this results in a finite area (not a point) of the body being in contact with the surface. The net effect is that the component of the contact force parallel to the surface opposes motion. We often regard friction as something undesirable. In many situations, like in a machine with different moving parts, friction does have a negative role. It opposes relative motion and thereby dissipates power in the form of heat, etc. Lubricants are a way of reducing kinetic friction in a machine. Another way is to use ball bearings between two moving parts of a machine (Fig. 4.13(a)). Since the rolling friction between ball bearings and the surfaces in contact is very small, power dissipation is reduced. A thin cushion of air maintained between solid surfaces in relative motion is another effective way of reducing friction (Fig. 4.13(a)). In many practical situations, however, friction is critically needed. Kinetic friction that dissipates power is nevertheless important for quickly stopping relative motion. It is made use of by brakes in machines and automobiles. Similarly, static friction is important in daily life. We are able to walk because of friction. It is impossible for a car to move on a very slippery road. On an ordinary road, the friction between the tyres and the road provides the necessary external force to accelerate the car.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of CIRCULAR MOTION",
    "answer": "We have seen in Chapter 4 that acceleration of a body moving in a circle of radius R with uniform speed v is v^2 / R directed towards the centre. According to the second law, the force f_c providing this acceleration is: f_c = m * v^2 / R where m is the mass of the body. This force directed towards the centre is called the centripetal force. For a stone rotated in a circle by a string, the centripetal force is provided by the tension in the string. The centripetal force for motion of a planet around the sun is the gravitational force on the planet due to the sun. **Fig. 4.14 Circular motion of a car** (a) For a car taking a circular turn on a horizontal road, the centripetal force is the force of friction. The circular motion of a car on a flat and banked road give interesting application of the laws of motion. Motion of a car on a level road (Fig. 4.14(a)): (i) The weight of the car, mg (ii) Normal reaction, N (iii) Frictional force, f As there is no acceleration in the vertical direction N - mg = 0 N = mg The centripetal force required for circular motion is along the surface of the road, and is provided by the component of the contact force between road and the car tyres along the surface. This by definition is the frictional force. Note that it is static friction that provides the centripetal acceleration. Static friction opposes the result. Motion of a car on a banked road (Fig. 4.14(b)): We can reduce the contribution of friction to the circular motion of the car if the road is banked (Fig. 4.14(b)). Since there is no acceleration along the vertical direction, the net force along this direction must be zero. Hence, N * cos(theta) = mg + f * sin(theta) The centripetal force is provided by the horizontal component of N and f N * sin(theta) + f * cos(theta) = m * v^2 / R But f = mu_s * N To obtain v_max we put f = mu_s * N Then Eqs. (4.19a) and (4.19b) become N * cos(theta) = mg + mu_s * N * sin(theta) N * sin(theta) + mu_s * N * cos(theta) = m * v^2 / R From Eq. (4.20a), we obtain N = mg / (cos(theta) - mu_s * sin(theta)) Substituting value of N in Eq. (4.20b), we get mg * (sin(theta) + mu_s * cos(theta)) / (cos(theta) - mu_s * sin(theta)) = m * v^2 / R or v_max = [(R * g * (1 + mu_s * tan(theta))) / (1 - mu_s * tan(theta))]^1/2 Comparing this with Eq. (4.18) we see that maximum possible speed of a car on a banked road is greater than that on a flat road. For mu_s = 0 in Eq. (4.21), v_0 = (R * g * tan(theta))^1/2 At this speed, frictional force is not needed at all to provide the necessary centripetal force. Driving at this speed on a banked road will cause little wear and tear of the tyres. The same equation also tells you that for v < v_0, frictional force will be up the slope and that a car can be parked only if tan(theta) ≤ mu_s.",

    "question": "Explain the concept of SOLVING PROBLEMS IN MECHANICS",
    "answer": "The three laws of motion that you have learnt in this chapter are the foundation of mechanics. You should now be able to handle a large variety of problems in mechanics. A typical problem in mechanics usually does not merely involve a single body under the action of given forces. More often, we will need to consider an assembly of different bodies exerting forces on each other. Besides, each body in the assembly experiences the force of gravity. When trying to solve a problem of this type, it is useful to remember the fact that we can choose any part of the assembly and apply the laws of motion to that part provided we include all forces on the chosen part due to the remaining parts of the assembly as well as the external forces on the chosen part of the assembly (plus any other agencies or forces) as the environment. We have followed the same **In simple terms, the law can be stated thus:** 1. Forces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies. Force on a body A by B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A. 2. The net force on a body is equal to the rate of change of its momentum with time, i.e. the acceleration of the body is proportional to the net force and is in the direction of the force. 3. Action and reaction act on different bodies and so they cannot cancel each other out. The internal action and reaction forces within a system cancel each other, sum to zero. 4. Law of Conservation of Momentum: The total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved. The law follows from the second and third law of motion. 5. Frictional force opposes impending or actual relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It is the component of the contact force along the common tangent to the surface in contact. Static friction (f_s) opposes impending relative motion, kinetic friction (f_k) opposes actual relative motion. They are independent of the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws: - f_s ≤ (f_s)_max = mu_s * N - f_k = mu_k * N where mu_s (coefficient of static friction) and mu_k (coefficient of kinetic friction) are constants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact. It is found experimentally that mu_s is less than mu_k. | Quantity       | Symbol | Units         | Dimensions    | Remarks                     | |----------------|--------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------------| | Momentum       | p      | kg m * s^-1 or N * s | [M L T^-1]    | p = m * a Second Law | | Force          | F      | N              | [M L T^-2]    | Impulse = force * time     | | Normal force   | N      | N              | [M L T^-2]    | Change in momentum         | | Static friction| f_s    | N              | [M L T^-2]    | f_s ≤ mu_s * N             | | Kinetic friction| f_k   | N              | [M L T^-2]    | f_k = mu_k * N             |",

    "question": "Explain the concept of Laws of Motion",
    "answer": "In the preceding Chapter, our concern was to describe the motion of a particle in space quantitatively. We saw that uniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas non-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in addition. So far, we have not asked the question as to what governs the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this basic question. Let us first guess the answer based on our common experience. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it. To throw a stone upwards, one has to give it an upward push. A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a strong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a flowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external agency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest. Likewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop motion. You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by applying a force against the direction of its motion. In these examples, the external agency of force (hands, wind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not always necessary. A stone released from the top of a building accelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the earth. A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance. **This shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and magnetic forces ) can exert force on a body even from a distance.** In short, a force is required to put a stationary body in motion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is needed to provide this force. The external agency may or may not be in contact with the body. So far so good. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g. a skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal ice slab)? **Is an external force required to keep a body in uniform motion?**",
