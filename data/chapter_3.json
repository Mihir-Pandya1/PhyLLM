    "content": "In the last chapter we developed the concepts of position, displacement, velocity and acceleration that are needed to describe the motion of an object along a straight line. We found that the directional aspect of these quantities can be taken care of by + and signs, as in one dimension only two directions are possible. But in order to describe motion of an object in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions (space), we need to use vectors to describe the above- mentioned physical quantities. Therefore, it is first necessary to learn the language of vectors. How to add, subtract and multiply vectors? What is the result of multiplying a vector by a real number? We shall learn this to enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and acceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object in a plane. As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail the projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of motion that has a special significance in daily-life situations. We shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail. The equations developed in this chapter for motion in a plane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions."

    "topic": "Scalars and Vectors",
    "content": "In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or vectors. Basically, the difference is that a direction is associated with a vector but not with a scalar. A scalar quantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified completely by a single number, along with the proper unit. Examples are the distance between two points, mass of an object, the temperature of a body and the time at which a certain event happened. The rules for combining scalars are the rules of ordinary algebra. Scalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided just as the ordinary numbers. For example, if the length and breadth of a rectangle are 1.0 m and 0.5 m respectively, then its perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the four sides, $1.0~m+0.5~m+1.0~m+0.5~m = 3.0~m$. The length of each side is a scalar and the perimeter is also a scalar. A vector quantity is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction and obeys the triangle law of addition or equivalently the parallelogram law of addition. So, a vector is specified by giving its magnitude by a number and its direction. Some physical quantities that are represented by vectors are displacement, velocity, acceleration and force. To represent a vector, we use a bold face type in this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be represented by a symbol v. Since bold face is difficult to produce, when written by hand, a vector is often represented by an arrow placed over a letter, say $\\vec{v}$. Thus, both v and $\\vec{v}$ represent the velocity vector. The magnitude of a vector is often called its absolute value, indicated by $|v|$. A vector is represented by a bold face, e.g. by A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light face A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y."

    "topic": "Position and Displacement Vectors",
    "content": "To describe the position of an object moving in a plane, we need to choose a convenient point, say O as origin. Let P and P' be the positions of the object at time t and t', respectively. We join O and P by a straight line. Then, OP is the position vector of the object at time t. An arrow is marked at the head of this line. It is represented by a symbol r, i.e. $OP=r$. Point P' is represented by another position vector, OP' denoted by r'. The length of the vector r represents the magnitude of the vector and its direction is the direction in which P lies as seen from O. If the object moves from P to P', the vector PP' (with tail at P and tip at P') is called the displacement vector corresponding to motion from point P (at time t) to point P' (at time t'). It is important to note that displacement vector is the straight line joining the initial and final positions and does not depend on the actual path undertaken by the object between the two positions. For example, given the initial and final positions as P and Q, the displacement vector is the same PQ for different paths of journey. Therefore, the magnitude of displacement is either less or equal to the path length of an object between two points. This fact was emphasised in the previous chapter also while discussing motion along a straight line."

Note that vectors A' and B' have the same magnitude but they are not equal because they have different directions. Even if we shift B' parallel to itself so that its tail Q' coincides with the tail O' of A', the tip S' of B' does not coincide with the tip P' of A'."

    "topic": "Multiplication of Vectors by Real Numbers",
    "content": "Multiplying a vector A with a positive number $\\lambda$ gives a vector whose magnitude is changed by the factor $\\lambda$ but the direction is the same as that of A: $|lambda A|=\\lambda|A|if~\\lambda>0$. For example, if A is multiplied by 2, the resultant vector 2A is in the same direction as A and has a magnitude twice of $|A|$. Multiplying a vector A by a negative number $-\\lambda$ gives another vector whose direction is opposite to the direction of A and whose magnitude is $\\lambda$ times A. The factor $\\lambda$ by which a vector A is multiplied could be a scalar having its own physical dimension. Then, the dimension of A is the product of the dimensions of $\\lambda$ and A. For example, if we multiply a constant velocity vector by duration (of time), we get a displacement vector."

    "topic": "Addition and Subtraction of Vectors - Graphical Method",
    "content": "Vectors, by definition, obey the triangle law or equivalently, the parallelogram law of addition. To find the sum $A+B$, we place vector B so that its tail is at the head of the vector A. Then, we join the tail of A to the head of B. This line OQ represents a vector R, that is, the sum of the vectors A and B. This graphical method is called the head-to-tail method. The two vectors and their resultant form three sides of a triangle, so this method is also known as triangle method of vector addition. If we find the resultant of $B+A$, the same vector R is obtained. Thus, vector addition is commutative: $A+B=B+A$. The addition of vectors also obeys the associative law: $(A+B)+C=A+(B+C)$. The sum of two equal and opposite vectors, A and -A, is a null vector or a zero vector, represented by 0, with zero magnitude: $A-A=0$. Subtraction of vectors is defined as the sum of two vectors A and -B: $A-B=A+(-B)$. We can also use the parallelogram method: bring their tails to a common origin, and the resultant vector R is the diagonal of the parallelogram from the common origin. The two methods are equivalent."

This is called resolving a vector into its component vectors. It is convenient to resolve a vector along the axes of a rectangular coordinate system using unit vectors $\\hat{i}$, $\\hat{j}$, and $\\hat{k}$ for the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. A vector A lying in the x-y plane can be expressed as $A=A_{x}\\hat{i}+A_{y}\\hat{j}$. The quantities $A_x$ and $A_y$ are the x- and y-components of A. These components can be expressed in terms of the magnitude A and angle $\\theta$ as $A_x = A \\cos\\theta$ and $A_y=A\\sin\\theta$. Conversely, the magnitude and direction can be found from the components using $A=\\sqrt{A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}}$ and $\\tan\\theta=\\frac{A_{y}}{A_{x}}$. For a vector A in three dimensions, the components are $A_x=A\\cos\\alpha$, $A_y=A\\cos\\beta$, and $A_z=A\\cos\\gamma$.

Thus, the components of the resultant vector are $R_{x}=A_{x}+B_{x}$ and $R_{y}=A_{y}+B_{y}$. This method can be extended to three dimensions. For a vector $T=a+b-c$, the components would be $T_{x}=a_{x}+b_{x}-c_{x}$, $T_{y}=a_{y}+b_{y}-c_{y}$, and $T_{z}=a_{z}+b_{z}-c_{z}$."
