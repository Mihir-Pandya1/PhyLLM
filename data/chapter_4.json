    "content": "In the preceding Chapter, our concern was to describe the motion of a particle in space quantitatively. We saw that uniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas non-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in addition. So far, we have not asked the question as to what governs the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this basic question. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it. To throw a stone upwards, one has to give it an upward push. A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a strong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a flowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external agency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest. Likewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop motion. You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by applying a force against the direction of its motion. In these examples, the external agency of force (hands, wind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not always necessary. A stone released from the top of a building accelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the earth. A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance. This shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and magnetic forces) can exert force on a body even from a distance. In short, a force is required to put a stationary body in motion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is needed to provide this force. The external agency may or may not be in contact with the body. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g. a skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal ice slab)? Is an external force required to keep a body in uniform motion?"

    "topic": "Aristotle's Fallacy",
    "content": "The question posed above appears to be simple. However, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the correct answer to this question given by Galileo in the seventeenth century was the foundation of Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the birth of modern science. The Greek thinker, Aristotle (384 B.C-322 B.C.), held the view that if a body is moving, something external is required to keep it moving. The Aristotelian law of motion may be phrased thus: An external force is required to keep a body in motion. This law is flawed because a moving toy car, for example, comes to rest because the external force of friction on the car by the floor opposes its motion. To counter this force, a child has to apply an external force on the car in the direction of motion. When the car is in uniform motion, there is no net external force acting on it: the force by the child cancels the force (friction) by the floor. If there were no friction, the child would not be required to apply any force to keep the toy car in uniform motion. Galileo imagined a world without frictional forces to arrive at the true law of nature for forces and motion."

    "topic": "The Law of Inertia",
    "content": "Galileo studied motion of objects on an inclined plane. He concluded that an object moving on a frictionless horizontal plane must neither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it should move with constant velocity. Another experiment by Galileo involved a double inclined plane, where a ball released from rest on one plane would climb up the other. In the ideal situation, when friction is absent, the final height of the ball is the same as its initial height. In the limiting case, when the slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a horizontal), the ball would travel an infinite distance, and its motion would never cease. Galileo arrived at the insight that the state of rest and the state of uniform linear motion (motion with constant velocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is no net force acting on the body. To maintain a body in uniform motion, an external force is needed to counter the frictional force, so that the two forces sum up to zero net external force. This property of the body is called inertia, which means 'resistance to change'. A body does not change its state of rest or uniform motion unless an external force compels it to change that state. The state of rest or uniform linear motion both imply zero acceleration. The first law of motion can be simply expressed as: If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero."

    "topic": "Ideas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science",
    "content": "Ancient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force was thought to be of different kinds: force due to continuous pressure (nodan), impact (abhighat), persistent tendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line (vega), or restoration of shape in an elastic body. The notion of (vega) perhaps comes closest to the concept of inertia. Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to be opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air resistance. It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational and vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent particles. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of motion and units of length and time. Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept of 'instantaneous motion' (tatkaliki gati), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous velocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly understood."

Newton's first law of motion states: Every body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise. If the net external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero. For example, a spaceship in interstellar space with its rockets turned off has no net external force acting on it, so its acceleration must be zero. If it is in motion, it continues to move with a uniform velocity. On Earth, an object at rest or in uniform linear motion is not because there are no forces acting on it, but because the various external forces cancel out to give a zero net external force. The property of inertia is evident when a bus suddenly starts or stops, causing passengers to be thrown backward or forward, respectively."

    "topic": "Newton's second law of motion",
    "content": "The first law refers to the simple case when the net external force on a body is zero. The second law of motion refers to the general situation when there is a net external force acting on the body. It relates the net external force to the acceleration of the body. Momentum (p) of a body is defined as the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v): $p=mv$ (4.1). The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction in which the force acts. The second law can be expressed as $F=k\\frac{dp}{dt}$ where k is a constant of proportionality. For a body of fixed mass, this can be written as $F=kma$. In SI units, k is chosen to be 1, so the law becomes $F=\\frac{dp}{dt}=ma$. The SI unit of force is the newton (N), defined as $1~N=1~kg~m~s^{-2}$. The second law is a vector law and is consistent with the first law (F=0 implies a=0). The acceleration at an instant is determined by the force at that instant, not by the history of the motion. The second law applies to a single point particle, a rigid body, or a system of particles, where F is the total external force and a is the acceleration of the system's center of mass. Impulse is defined as the product of force and time duration, which equals the change in momentum. For a seasoned cricketer catching a ball, drawing hands backward increases the time for the momentum change, thus requiring a smaller force."

    "content": "Impulse is the product of force and time duration, and it equals the change in momentum. It is a useful concept when a large force acts for a very short duration, producing a finite change in momentum. For example, when a ball hits a wall, the force and time duration are hard to measure separately, but the impulse (change in momentum) is a measurable quantity. A large force acting for a short time to produce a finite change in momentum is called an impulsive force. Newtonian mechanics makes no distinction between impulsive forces and other forces, except that they are large and short-acting."

The force on body A by B is equal and opposite to the force on body B by A ($F_{AB}=-F_{BA}$). The terms 'action' and 'reaction' mean nothing else but 'force'. There is no cause-effect relation implied; the forces act at the same instant. Action and reaction forces act on different bodies, so they cannot cancel each other out when considering the motion of a single body. However, for a system of two bodies, the internal action and reaction forces cancel away in pairs."

(ii) the ratio of the magnitudes of impulses imparted to the balls by the wall?\n\n**Answer**\nAn instinctive but wrong answer is that the force on the wall in case (b) is inclined at 30 degrees to the normal. The force on the wall is normal to the wall in both cases. Let u be the speed and m be the mass of each ball. We choose x and y axes as shown in the figure.\nCase (a): The initial x-component of momentum is $p_{x,initial}=mu$, and the final x-component is $p_{x,final}=-mu$. The y-component of momentum is zero both before and after the collision. The x-component of impulse is the change in momentum, which is $-2mu$. The force on the ball is in the negative x-direction, normal to the wall.

In an isolated system (one with no external force), the mutual forces between pairs of particles in the system can cause individual momentum changes, but since these forces are equal and opposite, the total momentum remains unchanged. This is the law of conservation of momentum: The total momentum of an isolated system of interacting particles is conserved. For a collision between two bodies A and B, with initial momenta $p_{A}$ and $p_{B}$, and final momenta $p'_{A}$ and $p'_{B}$ respectively, the total final momentum equals the initial momentum: $p'_{A}+p'_{B}=p_{A}+p_{B}$.

Other common forces are contact forces, which arise from contact with other objects. The component of a contact force normal to the surfaces is called normal reaction, and the component parallel to the surfaces is called friction. Other examples of contact forces include buoyant force, viscous force, and air resistance. Tension in a string and the force due to a spring are also common forces. For a spring, the restoring force F is proportional to the displacement x ($F=-kx$), where k is the force constant. At the microscopic level, these contact forces arise from electrical forces between the charged constituents of bodies."
